### 2.1. 🎯 1-100

【1】He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.  
【1】他是个独自在湾流中一条小船上钓鱼的老人，至今已去了八十四天，一条鱼也没逮住。头四十天里，有个男孩子跟他在一起。可是，过了四十天还没捉到一条鱼，孩子的父母对他说，老人如今准是十足地"倒了血霉"，这就是说，倒霉到了极点，于是孩子听从了他们的吩咐，上了另外一条船，头一个礼拜就捕到了三条好鱼。孩子看见老人每天回来时船总是空的，感到很难受，他总是走下岸去，帮老人拿卷起的钓索，或者鱼钩和鱼叉，还有绕在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋片打了些补丁，收拢后看来像是一面标志着永远失败的旗子。

【2】The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.  
【2】老人消瘦而憔悴，脖颈上有些很深的皱纹。腮帮上有些褐斑，那是太阳在热带海面上反射的光线所引起的良性皮肤癌变。褐斑从他脸的两侧一直蔓延下去，他的双手常用绳索拉大鱼，留下了刻得很深的伤疤。但是这些伤疤中没有一块是新的。它们像无鱼可打的沙漠中被侵蚀的地方一般古老。

【3】Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.  
【3】他浑身上下都透着苍老，唯独那双眼睛，颜色如海水般湛蓝，洋溢着欢快而不服输的神采。

【4】"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made some money."  
【4】"圣地亚哥，"男孩一边说着，一边和他从小船拖上岸的堤坝往上爬。"我可以再跟你出海。咱们最近赚了些钱。"

【5】The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.  
【5】老人曾教男孩捕鱼，男孩对他心怀敬爱。

【6】"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them."  
【6】"不，"老人说。"你现在跟的船运气好。跟着他们吧。"

【7】"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."  
【7】"可你还记得，你有八十七天没捕到鱼，后来我们却连续三个星期每天都捕到大鱼。"

【8】"I remember," the old man said. "I know you did not leave me because you doubted."  
【8】"我记得，"老人说。"我知道你不是因为怀疑才离开我的。"

【9】"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him."  
【9】"是爸爸逼我走的。我还是个孩子，必须听他的话。"

【10】"I know," the old man said. "It is quite normal."  
【10】"我知道，"老人说。"这很正常。"

【11】"He hasn't much faith."  
【11】"他没什么信心。"

【12】"No," the old man said. "But we have. Haven't we?"  
【12】"是啊，"老人说。"但咱们有。对吧？"

【13】"Yes," the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home."  
【13】"对，"男孩说。"我请你去露台喝杯啤酒，再把东西搬回家吧。"

【14】"Why not?" the old man said. "Between fishermen."  
【14】"那敢情好，"老人说。"渔夫之间就该这样。"

【15】They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.  
【15】他们坐在露台上，许多渔夫都拿老人打趣，他也不恼。其他年长的渔夫望着他，心中不免感伤，但并未表露，只是客气地谈论着海流、下钩的深度、持续的好天气，以及各自的见闻。当天收获颇丰的渔夫们早已回港，将枪鱼宰杀后平放在两块木板上——每块木板两端各由两人踉跄抬着——送往鱼库，等待冰车运往哈瓦那市场。那些捕到鲨鱼的人则把鱼送到海湾另一头的鲨鱼加工厂，用滑轮吊起，剖取肝脏，割下鱼鳍，剥去鱼皮，再将鱼肉切成条状腌制。

【16】When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.  
【16】东风起时，鲨鱼加工厂的腥味会飘过海港；但今日只有淡淡的气息，因为风向已转北，继而停息，露台上阳光和煦，令人惬意。

【17】"Santiago," the boy said.  
【17】"圣地亚哥，"孩子开口道。

【18】"Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.  
【18】"是啊，"老人说道。他握着酒杯，思绪飘回多年前的时光。

【19】"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?"  
【19】"明天我去给您弄些沙丁鱼来好吗？"

【20】"No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net."  
【20】"不用。去打棒球吧。我还能划船，罗赫略会撒网的。"

【21】"I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way."  
【21】"我想去。要是不能跟您一起打鱼，我总想帮点别的忙。"

【22】"You bought me a beer," the old man said. "You are already a man."  
【22】"你给我买了啤酒，"老人说。"你已经是个男子汉了。"

【23】"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?"  
【23】"你第一次带我上船时我多大？"

【24】"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?"  
【24】"五岁。那天我把鱼拖上来时它还活蹦乱跳，差点把船掀翻要了你的命。还记得吗？"

【25】"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."  
【25】"我记得鱼尾拍打得船舷砰砰响，坐板都断了。记得你把我扔到堆着湿漉漉钓索的船头，整条船都在颤抖。你像砍树似的用棍子揍它，腥甜的血溅得我满身都是。"

【26】"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?"  
【26】"你是真记得这事，还是我刚告诉你的？"

【27】"I remember everything from when we first went together."  
【27】"从我们第一次结伴出海起，每件事我都记得。"

【28】The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.  
【28】老人用那双被烈日灼伤却充满自信与慈爱的眼睛注视着他。

【29】"If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble," he said. "But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat."  
【29】"你要是我儿子，我定会带你出海赌运气，"他说。"可你是你爹妈的心头肉，又搭了条好运的船。"

【30】"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too."  
【30】"能给我些沙丁鱼吗？我知道哪儿还能弄到四条鱼饵。"

【31】"I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box."  
【31】"我今天还剩下些，用盐腌在盒子里了。"

【32】"Let me get four fresh ones."  
【32】"我去弄四条新鲜的来。"

【33】"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises.  
【33】"一条就够，"老人说。他的希望和信心从未消失，此刻正像微风初起时那般愈发鲜活。

【34】"Two," the boy said.  
【34】“两瓶，”男孩说。

【35】"Two," the old man agreed. "You didn't steal them?"  
【35】“两瓶，”老人附和道。“不是偷来的吧？”

【36】"I would," the boy said. "But I bought these."  
【36】“倒是想偷，”男孩说。“不过这两瓶是买的。”

【37】"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.  
【37】“多谢了，”老人说。他心思单纯，不会去琢磨自己何时变得如此谦卑。但他明白自己确实达到了这般境界，并且知道这并不丢人，也无损于真正的自尊。

【38】"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said.  
【38】"有了这股洋流，明天会是个好日子，"他说。

【39】"Where are you going?" the boy asked.  
【39】"你要去哪儿？"男孩问。

【40】"Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light."  
【40】"到远海去，等风向转了再回来。我想在天亮前就出海。"

【41】"I'll try to get him to work far out," the boy said. "Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid."  
【41】"我会想办法让他往远海作业，"男孩说。"这样你要是真钓到大鱼，我们就能赶来帮你。"

【42】"He does not like to work too far out."  
【42】"他不喜欢把船划得太远。"

【43】"No," the boy said. "But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin."  
【43】"是啊，"男孩说。"不过我能看见他看不见的东西，比如有只鸟在捕食，就可以叫他去追鲯鳅。"

【44】"Are his eyes that bad?"  
【44】"他眼睛那么差吗？"

【45】"He is almost blind."  
【45】"都快瞎了。"

【46】"It is strange," the old man said. "He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes."  
【46】"真奇怪，"老人说。"他从不捕海龟。那玩意儿最伤眼睛。"

【47】"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good."  
【47】"可你在莫斯基托海岸捕了好些年海龟，你的眼睛还是好好的。"

【48】"I am a strange old man."  
【48】"我是个不一般的老头儿。"

【49】"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?"  
【49】"但你现在还有力气对付一条真正的大鱼吗？"

【50】"I think so. And there are many tricks."  
【50】"我也这么觉得。而且这里头门道可多了。"

【51】"Let us take the stuff home," the boy said. "So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines."  
【51】"咱们把东西搬回家吧，"男孩说。"这样我就能拿上渔网去捕沙丁鱼了。"

【52】They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.  
【52】他们从船上收拾起渔具。老人把桅杆扛在肩上，男孩拎着那个木箱，里面盘着硬实的棕色钓索，还有鱼钩和带杆的鱼叉。装着鱼饵的箱子跟那根用来制服上钩大鱼的棍子一起放在船尾。虽然没人会偷老人的东西，但最好还是把帆和粗钓索带回家，露水对它们有害。尽管老人确信当地人不会偷他的东西，但他觉得把鱼钩和鱼叉留在船上总归是个不必要的诱惑。

【53】They walked up the road together to the old man's shack and went in through its open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough bud-shields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.  
【53】他们一起沿着小路走向老人的棚屋，从敞开的门走进去。老人把裹着帆的桅杆斜靠在墙边，男孩把木箱和其他渔具放在旁边。桅杆几乎和棚屋的单间一样长。棚屋是用王棕坚韧的苞叶——当地人称为"瓜诺"的材料搭建的，屋里有一张床、一张桌子、一把椅子，泥地上还有块烧木炭做饭的地方。褐色墙壁上挂着结实的瓜诺叶压片，上面钉着彩色的耶稣圣心像和科布雷圣母像。这些是他妻子的遗物。墙上原本还有张他妻子的着色照片，但被他取下来了，因为看见照片会让他倍感孤寂，现在照片放在角落的架子上，上面压着他干净的衬衫。

【54】"What do you have to eat?" the boy asked.  
【54】"你有什么吃的？"男孩问。

【55】"A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?"  
【55】"一锅黄米饭配鱼。要来点吗？"

【56】"No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?"  
【56】"不用，我回家吃。要我给你生火吗？"

【57】"No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold."  
【57】"不，我待会儿再做。或者就吃冷饭也行。"

【58】"May I take the cast net?"  
【58】"我能用撒网吗？"

【59】"Of course." 【59】"当然可以。"

【60】There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.  
【60】其实根本没有撒网，老人记得他们早就把它卖掉了。但每天他们都要重复这个心照不宣的谎言。也没有那锅黄米饭和鱼，孩子心里同样清楚。

【61】"Eighty-five is a lucky number," the old man said. "How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?"  
【61】"八十五是个吉利数字，"老人说。"你想不想看我钓一条净重超一千磅的鱼？"

【62】"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?"  
【62】"我去拿围网捞些沙丁鱼。你要不要坐在门口晒太阳？"

【63】"Yes. I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball."  
【63】"好。我有昨天的报纸，可以看看棒球消息。"

【64】The boy did not know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from under the bed.  
【64】男孩不知道昨天的报纸是否也是虚构的。但老人已从床底下把它掏了出来。

【65】"Perico gave it to me at the bodega," he explained.  
【65】"这是佩里科在小酒馆给我的，"他解释道。

【66】"I'll be back when I have the sardines. I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you can tell me about the baseball."  
【66】"等我弄到沙丁鱼就回来。我会把你那份和我那份一起冰镇起来，咱们明早分着吃。等我回来你再给我讲讲棒球赛的事。"

【67】"The Yankees cannot lose."  
【67】"扬基队不可能输。"

【68】"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland."  
【68】"但我担心克利夫兰的印第安人队。"

【69】"Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio."  
【69】"要对洋基队有信心，我的孩子。想想伟大的迪马乔。"

【70】"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland."  
【70】"我既害怕底特律的老虎队，也害怕克利夫兰的印第安人队。"

【71】"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago."  
【71】"小心点，否则你连辛辛那提的红人队和芝加哥的白袜队都会害怕。"

【72】"You study it and tell me when I come back."  
【72】"你研究研究，等我回来告诉我。"

【73】"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day."  
【73】"你觉得咱们该用 85 这个数字买张彩票吗？明天可就是第八十五天了。"

【74】"We can do that," the boy said. "But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?"  
【74】"当然可以，"男孩说。"可您当年八十七天的辉煌纪录怎么办？"

【75】"It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?"  
【75】"那种事不会发生第二次。你能弄到 85 这个号码吗？"

【76】"I can order one."  
【76】"我可以去预订一个。"

【77】"One sheet. That's two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?"  
【77】"一张床单。要两块五毛钱。咱们能找谁借这笔钱呢？"

【78】"That's easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half."  
【78】"这容易。我随时都能借到两块五毛钱。"

【79】"I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg."  
【79】"我想我也许能借到。但我尽量不借钱。先是借钱，接着就该乞讨了。"

【80】"Keep warm old man," the boy said. "Remember we are in September."  
【80】"老人家多保重，"男孩说，"别忘了现在是九月天。"

【81】"The month when the great fish come," the old man said. "Anyone can be a fisherman in May."  
【81】"大鱼到来的月份，"老人说。"谁都能在五月当个渔夫。"

【82】"I go now for the sardines," the boy said.  
【82】"我去拿沙丁鱼，"男孩说。

【83】When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man's shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. The old man's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.  
【83】男孩回来时，老人正坐在椅子里熟睡，太阳已经西沉。男孩从床上取下那条旧军毯，铺在椅背上，盖住老人的肩膀。那对肩膀很奇特，虽然年迈却依然结实有力，脖子也依旧强健，当老人垂头熟睡时，皱纹便不那么明显了。他的衬衫补了又补，活像那张帆布，日晒让补丁褪成了深浅不一的颜色。老人的头颅却显尽老态，闭着眼睛时，脸上毫无生气。报纸摊在他的膝头，被臂弯的重量压在晚风中。他赤着双脚。

【84】The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.  
【84】男孩没惊动他，再回来时老人仍在沉睡。

【85】"Wake up old man," the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man's knees.  
【85】"醒醒，老家伙，"男孩说着把手搭在老人膝盖上。

【86】The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled.  
【86】老人睁开眼，恍惚间仿佛从遥远的地方归来。随后他露出笑容。

【87】"What have you got?" he asked.  
【87】"带了什么来？"他问道。

【88】"Supper," said the boy. "We're going to have supper."  
【88】"晚饭，"男孩说。"咱们该吃晚饭了。"

【89】"I'm not very hungry."  
【89】"我不太饿。"

【90】"Come on and eat. You can't fish and not eat."  
【90】"快来吃吧。总不能光打鱼不吃饭。"

【91】"I have," the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket.  
【91】"吃过了，"老人说着站起身，拿起报纸折好，又开始叠毯子。

【92】"Keep the blanket around you," the boy said. "You'll not fish without eating while I'm alive."  
【92】"把毯子披好，"男孩说。"只要我活着，就不能让你饿着肚子去打鱼。"

【93】"Then live a long time and take care of yourself," the old man said. "What are we eating?"  
【93】"那你要活得久些，好好保重自己，"老人说。"我们吃什么？"

【94】"Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew."  
【94】"黑豆米饭、炸香蕉，还有些炖菜。"

【95】The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.  
【95】男孩用双层金属餐盒从露台餐厅带来了这些食物。两套刀叉和汤匙装在他口袋里，每套餐具都用纸巾包着。

【96】"Who gave this to you?"  
【96】"这是谁给你的？"

【97】"Martin. The owner."  
【97】"马丁。店主。"

【98】"I must thank him."  
【98】"我得谢谢他。"

【99】"I thanked him already," the boy said. "You don't need to thank him."  
【99】"我已经谢过他了，"男孩说。"你不用再谢了。"

【100】"I'll give him the belly meat of a big fish," the old man said. "Has he done this for us more than once?"  
【100】"我要送他一块大鱼肚腩，"老人说。"他这样帮过我们不止一次了吧？"

### 2.2. 🎯 101-200

【101】"I think so." 【101】"我也这么认为。"

【102】"I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us."  
【102】"那我必须给他比腹肉更好的东西。他对我们考虑得很周到。"

【103】"He sent two beers."  
【103】"他送了两瓶啤酒。"

【104】"I like the beer in cans best."  
【104】"我最喜欢罐装啤酒。"

【105】"I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles."  
【105】"我知道。但这是瓶装的，哈图伊啤酒，我会把瓶子退回去。"

【106】"That's very kind of you," the old man said. "Should we eat?"  
【106】"你真是太好了，"老人说。"我们该吃饭了吗？"

【107】"I've been asking you to," the boy told him gently. "I have not wished to open the container until you were ready."  
【107】"我一直在等你开口，"男孩轻声告诉他。"我想等你准备好了再打开食盒。"

【108】"I'm ready now," the old man said. "I only needed time to wash."  
【108】"我现在准备好了，"老人说。"只是需要点时间洗个澡。"

【109】Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.  
【109】你在哪儿洗的？男孩心想。村里的供水处在沿路往下两条街外。我该给他备好水，男孩想，还有肥皂和一条好毛巾。我怎么这么粗心？得给他再弄件衬衫、一件过冬的外套、一双鞋，还有一条毯子。

【110】"Your stew is excellent," the old man said.  
【110】"你炖的菜真好吃，"老人说。

【111】"Tell me about the baseball," the boy asked him.  
【111】"给我讲讲棒球赛吧，"男孩请求道。

【112】"In the American League it is the Yankees as I said," the old man said happily.  
【112】"就像我说的，美联那边还得是扬基队，"老人乐呵呵地说道。

【113】"They lost today," the boy told him.  
【113】"他们今天输了，"男孩告诉他。

【114】"That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again."  
【114】"这不算什么。伟大的迪马乔又找回状态了。"

【115】"They have other men on the team."  
【115】"队里还有别的球员呢。"

【116】"Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park."  
【116】"当然。但他与众不同。在另一联盟里，布鲁克林和费城之间我肯定选布鲁克林。不过我又想起迪克·西斯勒在老球场那些精彩的长打。"

【117】"There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen."  
【117】"那些击球简直无与伦比。他打出的球是我见过飞得最远的。"

【118】"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid."  
【118】"还记得他常来露台的时候吗？我想带他去钓鱼，但怯于开口。后来让你去邀请他，结果你也胆怯。"

【119】"I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives."  
【119】"是啊。真是大错特错。他本可能跟我们同去的。那样我们就能终生珍藏这段回忆了。"

【120】"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."  
【120】"我想带伟大的迪马吉奥去钓鱼，"老人说。"听说他父亲就是个渔夫。也许他当年和我们一样穷，能理解我们。"

【121】"The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the big leagues when he was my age."  
【121】"伟大的西斯勒的父亲可从不穷困，他父亲在我这个年纪时，早就在大联盟打球了。"

【122】"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening."  
【122】"我像你这么大时，正在一艘开往非洲的横帆船前桅干活，傍晚在沙滩上见过狮子呢。"

【123】"I know. You told me."  
【123】"知道。你跟我说过。"

【124】"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?"  
【124】"咱们聊聊非洲还是聊聊棒球？"

【125】"Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J.  
【125】"我想听棒球，"男孩说。"给我讲讲伟大的约翰·J·麦格劳吧。"他把字母 J 念成了"霍塔"。

【126】"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone."  
【126】"早年他偶尔也会来露台餐厅。但喝醉后就变得粗鲁刻薄、难以相处。他满脑子除了棒球就是赛马。至少他口袋里总揣着马匹名单，打电话时也经常念叨马的名字。"

【127】"He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest."  
【127】"他是位伟大的球队经理，"男孩说。"我父亲认为他是最棒的。"

【128】"Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager."  
【128】"因为他来得最勤，"老人说。"要是杜罗谢每年都来这儿，你父亲准会认为他是最棒的经理人。"

【129】"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?"  
【129】"那到底谁才是最棒的经理人，卢克还是迈克·冈萨雷斯？"

【130】"I think they are equal."  
【130】"我觉得他们不相上下。"

【131】"And the best fisherman is you."  
【131】"而最棒的渔夫是你。"

【132】"No. I know others better."  
【132】"不，我更了解其他人。"

【133】"Qué va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you."  
【133】"哪里的话，"男孩说。"好渔夫很多，还有些非常出色的。但你是独一无二的。"

【134】"Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong."  
【134】"谢谢。你让我很开心。但愿不会出现一条大到能证明我们错了的鱼。"

【135】"There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say."  
【135】"若真如你所言这般强壮，海里早该没鱼可捕了。"

【136】"I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution."  
【136】"或许我没自己想的那么壮实，"老人说。"但我懂不少诀窍，更有股子韧劲。"

【137】"You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."  
【137】"你该去睡了，明早才能精神足。我把家伙什儿捎回露台酒店。"

【138】"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning."  
【138】"那晚安了。明早我来叫你。"

【139】"You're my alarm clock," the boy said.  
【139】"你就是我的闹钟，"男孩说。

【140】"Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?"  
【140】"年纪就是我的闹钟，"老人说。"为什么老人总是醒得这么早？难道是为了拥有更长的一天吗？"

【141】"I don't know," the boy said. "All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard."  
【141】"我不知道，"男孩说。"我只知道年轻男孩总是睡得又晚又沉。"

【142】"I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time."  
【142】"我还记得那种感觉，"老人说。"我会准时叫醒你的。"

【143】"I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior."  
【143】"我不喜欢被他叫醒的感觉。那会让我显得低人一等。"

【144】"I know." 【144】"我明白。"

【145】"Sleep well, old man."  
【145】"睡个好觉，老人家。"

【146】The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.  
【146】男孩离开了。他们在没有灯光的餐桌旁吃完晚饭，老人脱下裤子摸黑上了床。他把裤子卷起来当枕头，里面塞着报纸。他用毯子裹住自己，睡在铺满床垫弹簧的旧报纸上。

【147】He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.  
【147】他很快便沉沉睡去，梦见年少时见过的非洲，那绵延的金色沙滩与雪白的海岸，白得刺眼，还有高耸的海岬与褐色的巍峨群山。如今每个夜晚他都沿着那片海岸线神游，梦中听见浪涛轰鸣，望见土著人的小船破浪而来。熟睡时他嗅到甲板上沥青与麻絮的气味，清晨又闻到陆风捎来的非洲气息。

【148】Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.  
【148】往常嗅到陆风的气息，他就会醒来穿衣去叫醒男孩。但今夜陆风的气味来得太早，他在梦中便知时辰未到，于是继续酣睡，梦见群岛的白色峰顶从海面升起，继而梦到加那利群岛各处不同的港湾与锚地。

【149】He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.  
【149】他不再梦见风暴，不再梦见女人，不再梦见伟业，不再梦见大鱼，不再梦见搏斗，不再梦见角力，也不再梦见妻子。如今他只梦见一些地方，还有海滩上的狮子。它们在暮色中像小猫般嬉戏，他爱它们如同爱那孩子。他从不梦见那孩子。他只是醒来，望望敞开的门外边的月亮，摊开裤子穿上。他在窝棚外撒了尿，然后顺着大路走去叫醒孩子。清晨的寒气让他直哆嗦。但他知道哆嗦一阵就会暖和起来，而且很快就要划船了。

【150】The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.  
【150】孩子住的房子没上锁，他推开门，光着脚悄悄走进去。孩子在外间屋的小帆布床上熟睡着，借着将尽的月光，老人能清楚地看见他。他轻轻握住孩子的一只脚，直到孩子醒来，转过脸望着他。老人点点头，孩子从床边的椅子上拿起裤子，坐在床沿上穿了起来。

【151】The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry."  
【151】老人走出门，男孩跟在他身后。男孩睡眼惺忪，老人揽住他的肩膀说："真过意不去。"

【152】"Qué va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do."  
【152】"别这么说，"男孩道。"男子汉都该这样。"

【153】They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.  
【153】他们沿路走向老人的棚屋，黑暗中可见赤脚的渔夫们扛着船桅在路上往来。

【154】When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.  
【154】来到棚屋前，男孩取出篮里的钓索卷儿，又拿起鱼叉和鱼钩，老人则把缠着帆布的桅杆扛在肩上。

【155】"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked.  
【155】"要喝咖啡吗？"男孩问道。

【156】"We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some."  
【156】"咱们先把渔具搬上船，再去喝。"

【157】They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.  
【157】他们在专做渔民生意的早摊上用炼乳罐喝着咖啡。

【158】"How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.  
【158】"睡得怎么样，老伙计？"男孩问。此刻他虽仍睡眼惺忪，但已逐渐清醒过来。

【159】"Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today."  
【159】"好的，马诺林，"老人说。"今天我信心十足。"

【160】"So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."  
【160】"我也是，"男孩说。"现在我得去拿你的沙丁鱼和我的，还有你的新鲜鱼饵。他自己会把渔具带来。从不让别人帮忙拿东西。"

【161】"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old."  
【161】"我们不一样，"老人说。"你五岁时我就让你帮忙拿东西了。"

【162】"I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here."  
【162】"我知道，"男孩说。"我马上回来。再喝杯咖啡吧。我们在这里可以赊账。"

【163】He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored.  
【163】他赤脚踩过珊瑚礁岩，走向存放鱼饵的冰屋。

【164】The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.  
【164】老人慢慢啜饮着咖啡。这是他一整天的口粮，他明白必须喝下去。长久以来进食对他已成负担，他从不带午饭。小舟船头放着一瓶水，这就是他一天所需的全部。

【165】The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.  
【165】男孩此时带着沙丁鱼和用报纸包着的两枚鱼饵回来了，他们沿着小径走向渔船，脚底感受着圆砾沙滩的触感，合力抬起小船，让它滑入水中。

【166】"Good luck old man."  
【166】"祝你好运，老伙计。"

【167】"Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.  
"祝你好运，"老人说道。他将桨绳套在桨栓上，身子前倾抵住水中桨叶的推力，开始在黑暗中划出港口。其他海滩也有船只出海，老人虽因月亮已落山而看不见它们，却能听见那些船桨起落划水的声响。

【168】Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.  
【168】偶尔会有船上传来说话声。但除了桨叶划水的声响，大多数船只都静默无声。驶出港口后，船队便四散开来，各自朝着他们认为有鱼群的海域前进。老人知道自己要驶向远海，他将陆地的气息抛在身后，划进清晨纯净的海洋气息中。当他划过渔夫们称为"大井"的海域时，看见水中马尾藻发出的磷光——这里因洋流冲击海底陡壁形成漩涡，突然出现七百英寻的深坑，各类鱼群便在此聚集。最深处的洞穴里密集着虾群和饵鱼，有时还有成群的乌贼，这些生物夜间会游近海面，成为所有巡游鱼类的美餐。

【169】In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, "The birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea."  
【169】黑暗中，老人能感觉到黎明将至。他划着船，听见飞鱼跃出水面时的颤音，以及它们僵硬的翅膀在黑暗中翱翔时发出的嘶嘶声。他非常喜爱飞鱼，因为它们是他在海上的主要伙伴。他为鸟儿感到难过，尤其是那些娇小的黑色燕鸥，它们总在不停地飞翔寻觅，却几乎一无所获。他想："除了那些强盗鸟和强壮的大鸟外，鸟儿的生存比我们艰难多了。既然海洋如此残酷，为何要把海燕这样的鸟儿造得如此纤弱精致？大海仁慈而美丽，但她也会突然变得残暴。这些发出微弱哀鸣、俯冲捕食的鸟儿，对海洋而言实在太过脆弱了。"

【170】He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.  
【170】他总是把大海称作"la mar"，这是西班牙语里人们对她的爱称。那些爱她的人有时会说她的坏话，但总把她当作女人来谈论。有些年轻渔夫——那些用浮标当钓线浮子、开着摩托艇的年轻人（他们用鲨鱼肝赚了大钱才买得起这些装备）——则称她为"el mar"，这是阳性词。他们把她视为对手、场所，甚至敌人。但老人始终认为她是阴性的，是施与或收回恩惠的存在，即便她做出狂野或恶劣之事，那也是情非得已。他想，月亮影响她就如同影响女人一般。

【171】He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.  
【171】他稳健地划着船，丝毫不费力气，因为他始终控制着速度，而且海面平坦如镜，只有偶尔的涡流扰动。他让洋流承担了三分之一的活计。天光初现时，他发现自己此刻的位置比预期中离岸更远。

【172】I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonita and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.  
【172】他在深水区钓了一周都毫无收获，心想。今天我要找到鲣鱼和长鳍金枪鱼群的位置，说不定能碰上条大鱼。

【173】Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.  
【173】天还没大亮，他就已放下钓饵随波漂流。第一个钓饵垂在四十英寻深处，第二个在七十五英寻，第三第四个则悬在碧蓝的百英寻及百二十五英寻深水处。每个钓饵都头朝下倒悬着，钓钩的柄部牢牢缝扎在饵鱼体内，所有外露部分——钩弯和钩尖——都裹着新鲜沙丁鱼。每条沙丁鱼都双眼穿钩，在钢钩外沿形成半圈花环。大鱼能触及的钩身部位，无不散发着香甜美味。

【174】The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.  
【174】男孩给了他两条新鲜的小金枪鱼，或称长鳍金枪鱼，它们像铅锤般挂在两根最深的钓线上；其他钓线上则挂着一条大蓝鲹和一条之前用过的黄尾鰤——不过它们依然状态良好，配上那些极品沙丁鱼作饵，足以散发诱人气息。每根如粗铅笔般粗细的钓线都系在一根青翠的钓竿上，鱼饵稍有拉扯就会让竿尖轻点；每根钓线还备有两卷四十英寻的线圈，可随时接上备用线轴，这样若有需要，鱼儿能拖出三百多英寻的钓线。

【175】Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.  
【175】此刻老人紧盯着舷边三根钓竿的动静，轻划船桨让钓线始终垂直悬在恰当的深度。天已大亮，朝阳随时会跃出海面。

【176】The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.  
【176】太阳从海面薄薄地升起，老人能看见其他渔船低低地浮在水面上，朝着海岸方向散开，顺着洋流排开。随后阳光愈发明亮，海面泛起刺目的反光，当太阳完全升起时，平坦的海面将阳光直射进他的眼睛，灼得生疼，于是他划着船，不再直视阳光。他低头望向海水，注视着那些笔直垂入幽暗深处的钓线。他总能把钓线绷得比别人都直，这样在暗流的每一层深度，鱼饵都能精准地悬在他预想的位置，静候游经的鱼群。别人总任由钓线随波漂移，有时渔夫以为放到了百英寻深，实际只有六十英寻。

【177】But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.  
【177】但老人心想，我的钓线分毫不差。只不过近来运气不佳。可谁知道呢？也许就在今天。每天都是崭新的日子。走运固然好。但我宁愿做到分毫不差。这样运气降临时，你已万事俱备。

【178】The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.  
【178】此刻太阳又爬高了两小时，朝东望去已不那么刺眼。视野里只剩三条渔船，它们显得又低又小，远远地挨着海岸线。

【179】All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.  
【179】"这一生，朝阳总刺痛我的眼睛，"老人想。"不过它们依然好用。傍晚时分，我可以直视落日而不觉昏暗。黄昏的太阳更有力量。但晨光总是伤眼。"

【180】Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again.  
【180】就在这时，他看见一只军舰鸟展开漆黑的长翼，在前方的天空盘旋。它倏然俯冲，后掠的双翅斜掠而下，继而又开始盘旋。

【181】"He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking."  
【181】"它发现猎物了，"老人出声说道。"不单是随便看看。"

【182】He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.  
【182】他朝着鸟儿盘旋的方向缓慢而平稳地划去。他不慌不忙，让钓索保持笔直垂入水中。但他稍稍顺着海流划行，这样既保持了正确的垂钓方式，又比不借助鸟儿指引时行进得更快些。

【183】The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.  
【183】那鸟儿在空中飞得更高了，又盘旋起来，双翅纹丝不动。接着它猛然俯冲而下，老人看见飞鱼窜出水面，拼命掠过海面。

【184】"Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin."  
【184】“鲯鳅，”老人出声说道，“大鲯鳅。”

【185】He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.  
【185】他收起船桨，从船头下方取出一根细钓线。线上连着金属接钩绳和中号钓钩，他挂上一条沙丁鱼作饵。他把钓线从船舷放下水，然后将它牢牢系在船尾的系缆桩上。接着又给另一根钓线装上鱼饵，盘好放在船头的阴凉处。他继续划船，并注视着那只长翅黑鸟，此刻它正低低地在水面上忙碌着。

【186】As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are wide spread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.  
【186】老人看见那鸟儿再次俯冲，倾斜着翅膀准备俯冲，随后又疯狂而徒劳地扑扇着翅膀追逐飞鱼。他能看见海豚群追捕逃窜的鱼群时，硕大的身躯在水中拱起的细微水纹。海豚们正从飞鱼群下方破水而行，待飞鱼落水时便能全速追击。这可是大群海豚啊，他思忖着。它们分布范围极广，飞鱼几乎没有生路。那只鸟儿更没机会——飞鱼体型太大，速度也太快。

【187】He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.  
【187】他望着飞鱼一次次跃出水面，看着鸟儿徒劳的追逐动作。那群鱼已经甩开我了，他想。它们游得太快太远了。但说不定能逮到条落单的，也许我的大鱼就在它们附近。我的大鱼总该在某个地方。

【188】The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.  
【188】陆地上空的云团此刻如群山般隆起，海岸只剩下一道绵长的绿线，后方衬着灰蓝色的丘陵。海水此刻呈现深蓝色，深得近乎发紫。他俯视水中，看见深色水体里浮游生物泛起的红色微尘，以及阳光此刻造就的奇异光晕。他注视着钓线，看着它们笔直垂入视线不可及的水中，见到这么多浮游生物令他欣喜，因为这意味着鱼群的存在。太阳升高后在水里形成的奇异光晕昭示着好天气，陆地上空的云团形状也印证了这点。但那只鸟几乎已消失不见，海面上除了几片被阳光漂白的黄色马尾藻，就只有紧挨小船漂浮的僧帽水母——那紫色、规整、泛着虹彩的凝胶状浮囊。它侧翻后又恢复原状，像气泡般欢快地漂浮着，身后拖曳着长达一码的致命紫色触须。

【189】"Agua mala," the man said. "You whore."  
【189】"恶水母，"老人说。"你这婊子。"

【190】From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.  
【190】他轻轻荡着双桨，俯视水中，看见那些色彩如同拖曳触须的小鱼在漂移的气泡投下的阴影间游弋。它们对毒液免疫。但人类不然，当老人捕鱼时，若有几根黏滑的紫色触须缠上钓线，他的手臂和手掌便会泛起毒葛藤或毒橡树般的红肿疮疤。不过僧帽水母的毒刺来得迅猛，痛如鞭笞。

【191】The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.  
【191】虹彩气泡美不胜收。可它们是海洋中最虚伪的造物，老人却爱看大海龟将其吞食。海龟发现气泡后，会正面逼近，继而闭目缩入甲壳，连触须带气泡一并囫囵吞下。老人爱看这场景，也爱在暴风雨后踏上海滩，用脚底老茧踩爆这些气泡，听它们噼啪作响。

【192】He loved green turtles and hawks-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.  
他钟爱绿海龟和玳瑁，欣赏它们优雅的姿态与迅捷的速度，更珍视其极高的价值；而对那些体型庞大、行动笨拙的蠵龟，他则带着善意的轻蔑——它们身披暗黄色甲壳，交配方式古怪，还会闭着眼睛津津有味地吞食僧帽水母。

【193】He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.  
【193】他对海龟并无迷信，尽管乘龟船捕鱼多年。他为所有海龟感到难过，连那些与小船等长、重达一吨的巨型棱皮龟也不例外。多数人对海龟冷酷无情，因为海龟被宰杀分割后，心脏还能持续跳动数小时。但老人心想：我也有这样的心脏，我的手脚和它们一样。他吃白色龟蛋来增强体力，整个五月都在吃，就为在九十月间有力气对付真正的大鱼。

【194】He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.  
【194】他每天还从渔夫们存放器具的窝棚里，舀一杯鲨鱼肝油喝。那口大桶是为所有需要的渔夫准备的。多数渔夫厌恶这味道，但总比天不亮就起床好受些。这油防治感冒流感很有效，对眼睛也有益处。

【195】Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.  
【195】此刻老人抬头望去，看见那只鸟又在盘旋。

【196】"He's found fish," he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it.  
【196】"他找到鱼群了，"老人出声说道。海面上不见飞鱼跃起，也没有饵鱼四散逃窜。但老人正观察时，一条小金枪鱼突然跃出水面，在空中转身，头朝下扎进水里。金枪鱼在阳光下银光闪闪，紧接着第二条、第三条接连跃起，它们从四面八方跳窜着，把海水搅得翻腾不已，为了追逐饵鱼而高高跃起。它们围着鱼群打转，驱赶着它们。

【197】If they don't travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.  
【197】要是它们游得不太快，我就能赶到鱼群那儿去，老人心想。他注视着鱼群把海水搅得泛白，此刻那只鸟也俯冲下来，扎进被鱼群吓得浮到水面的饵鱼中。

【198】"The bird is a great help," the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna's shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.  
【198】"这只鸟真是帮了大忙，"老人说道。就在此刻，船尾的钓线突然在他脚下绷紧——他早先在那里留了个线圈——他立刻放下船桨，当紧紧攥住钓线开始收线时，能感受到那条小金枪鱼颤抖的拉力。随着他不断收线，鱼儿的挣扎愈发剧烈，湛蓝的鱼背和鎏金般的鱼腹在水面下忽隐忽现，最终被甩过船舷落入船中。它躺在船尾的阳光里，身形如子弹般结实，呆滞的大眼睛直瞪着，优雅而迅捷的尾巴急促拍打着船板，在阵阵战栗中耗尽最后一丝生气。老人出于怜悯敲击它的头部，又将它踢到船尾阴凉处，那躯体仍在不停抽搐。

【199】"Albacore," he said aloud. "He'll make a beautiful bait. He'll weigh ten pounds."  
【199】"长鳍金枪鱼，"他朗声说道，"会成为绝佳的鱼饵。少说有十磅重。"

【200】He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself. He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy.  
【200】他不记得从何时起开始独自自言自语。早年独处时他会唱歌，有时夜间在单桅帆船或捕龟船上独自掌舵值班时也唱。或许是在男孩离开后，他才开始自说自话。但具体时间已记不清了。从前和男孩一起捕鱼时，他们只在必要时才交谈，通常在夜间或遇到暴风雨被困时才说话。在海上避免无谓的闲谈被视为美德，老人也一直这么认为并恪守此道。但如今他常常把心里话大声说出来，反正不会打扰到任何人。

### 2.3. 🎯 201-300

【201】"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy," he said aloud. "But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball."  
【201】"要是别人听见我自言自语，准以为我疯了，"他出声说道。"可既然我没疯，也就不在乎。那些有钱人船上有收音机对着他们说话，还能听棒球赛呢。"

【202】Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know?  
【202】现在可不是想棒球的时候，他想。现在只能想一件事。那件我生来就该做的事。鱼群附近可能藏着条大的，他想。我只逮到条掉队的鲣鱼。但它们游得又快又远。今天浮上水面的鱼都游得飞快，朝东北方向去。是因为时辰不对？还是有什么我不懂的天气征兆？

【203】He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.  
【203】此刻他望不见岸边的绿意，只见蓝色山峦的顶端泛着雪峰般的白，以及状如高耸雪山的云朵。海水呈现出深沉的暗色，阳光在水面折射出棱镜般的光斑。浮游生物的万千光点此刻已被正午的太阳抹去，老人只看见蓝色深渊里巨大的棱镜光柱——他的钓线笔直垂入足有一英里深的海水中。

【204】The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down again. The sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.  
【204】金枪鱼又沉下去了，渔夫们把所有这类鱼都叫作金枪鱼，只有等到要卖出去或是拿它们换鱼饵的时候，才用各自的专名来区分。此刻阳光灼热，老人划着船，感到脖颈后火辣辣的，汗珠顺着脊背往下淌。

【205】I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.  
【205】我大可以随波漂流，他想，睡上一觉，把钓线在脚趾上绕一圈，有动静就能醒我。但今天是第八十五天了，我得好好钓一天鱼。

【206】Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.  
【206】正盯着钓线时，他突然看见其中一根挑出的绿竿子猛地往下一沉。

【207】"Yes," he said. "Yes," and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.  
【207】"来了，"他说。"来了，"随即轻轻收桨，没让船身晃动。他伸手去够钓线，用右手拇指和食指轻轻捏住。没感到紧绷，也没多少分量，他就这么轻握着。接着钓线又动了一下。这回是试探性的一扯，既不实在也不沉重，他立刻明白是怎么回事。一百英寻深的水下，一条枪鱼正在吞食包住钩尖和钩身的沙丁鱼，那手工锻造的钩子从小金枪鱼的头部伸出来。

【208】The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.  
【208】老人用左手轻轻地握住钓线，将它从绕线轮上缓缓放出。现在他可以让钓线从指间滑过，而不会让鱼儿感到丝毫拉力。

【209】This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them. Please eat them. How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them.  
【209】在这么远的地方，这个月份的鱼肯定大得很，他想。吃掉它们吧，鱼儿。吃掉它们。请吃掉它们。这些饵多新鲜啊，而你在六百英尺深的黑暗冷水里。在黑暗中再转个弯回来吃掉它们吧。

【210】He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine's head must have been more difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.  
【210】他感觉到钓线先是轻微地颤动，随后猛然一沉——想必是沙丁鱼头更难挣脱鱼钩。接着便再无动静。

【211】"Come on," the old man said aloud. "Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren't they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don't be shy, fish. Eat them."  
【211】“来吧，”老人高声说道。“再转个弯。闻闻这些鱼饵。它们不香吗？趁现在好好享用，后面还有金枪鱼呢。又硬又凉，美味极了。别害羞，鱼儿。吃掉它们。”

【212】He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same delicate pulling touch again.  
【212】他用拇指和食指捏着钓线等待着，同时观察着这根线和其他钓线的动静——那鱼可能游向了上方或下方。这时那种轻微的拉扯感又来了。

【213】"He'll take it," the old man said aloud. "God help him to take it."  
【213】“它会咬钩的，”老人出声说道。“愿上帝保佑它咬钩。”

【214】He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.  
【214】可它终究没咬钩。它游走了，老人什么也没感觉到。

【215】"He can't have gone," he said. "Christ knows he can't have gone. He's making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it."  
【215】"它不可能逃走，"他说。"天知道它不可能逃走。它只是在兜圈子。也许它以前上过钩，还记得些教训。"

【216】Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.  
【216】这时他感到钓索上传来轻柔的牵动，顿时欣喜起来。

【217】"It was only his turn," he said. "He'll take it."  
【217】"不过是它在转身，"他说。"它会咬钩的。"

【218】He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man's fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.  
【218】他欣喜地感受着那轻柔的拉扯，随后却触到某种坚硬而沉重得难以置信的东西。那是鱼的重量，他任由钓索向下滑落，不断下坠，直至从两卷备用钓线中放出了第一卷。钓索从老人指间轻快地滑落时，他仍能感受到那巨大的重量，尽管拇指和食指施加的压力几乎微不可察。

【219】"What a fish," he said. "He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it."  
【219】"好一条大鱼，"他说。"它现在把鱼饵横叼在嘴里，正拖着游走呢。"

【220】Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.  
【220】跟着它就会转身把饵吞下去，他想。这话他没说出口，因为他知道好事一说破就不灵了。他清楚这是条多大的鱼，想象着它黑暗中口衔金枪鱼横向游动的模样。这时他感觉鱼停止游动，但拉力仍在。接着拉力加剧，他又放出些钓线。他用拇指和食指紧捏钓线片刻，感到下坠力道加重，直往深处沉去。

【221】"He's taken it," he said. "Now I'll let him eat it well."  
【221】"它咬钩了，"他说。"现在我要让它好好享用。"

【222】He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using.  
【222】他任由钓线从指间滑出，同时左手向下探去，将两卷备用钓线的活端牢牢系在另一根钓线的备用线圈上。现在他准备就绪了。除了正在使用的钓线外，他还有三卷四十英寻长的备用线。

【223】"Eat it a little more," he said. "Eat it well."  
【223】“再多吃一点吧，”他说。“好好吃。”

【224】Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table?  
【224】吃下去让钓钩的尖儿戳进你的心脏，把你弄死，他想。轻松愉快地浮上来吧，让我把鱼叉刺进你的身子。得了。你准备好了？你进餐的时间够长了吗？

【225】"Now!" he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.  
【225】“现在！”他嚷出声来，用双手使劲猛拉钓索，收进了一码，然后连连猛拉，使出胳膊上的全副劲儿，拿身子的重量作为支撑，挥动双臂，轮换地把钓索往回拉。

【226】Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the North-West.  
【226】一点用也没有。那鱼只顾慢慢地游开去，老人无法把它往上拉一英寸。他这钓索很结实，是制作来钓大鱼的，他把它紧紧地攥在脊背上，攥得那么紧，竟勒痛了背上的肌肉，勒得他的背脊都痛得麻木了。接着钓索在水里的斜度改变了，他攥着钓索，在座板上死劲撑住了自己的身子，仰着上半身来抵消鱼的拉力。船儿慢慢地向西北方向驶去。

【227】The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.  
【227】鱼儿稳稳地游着，小船在平静的水面上缓缓前行。其他钓饵仍在水里，但已无计可施。

【228】"I wish I had the boy," the old man said aloud. "I'm being towed by a fish and I'm the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down."  
【228】"要是有那孩子在就好了，"老人出声说道。"我现在被鱼拖着走，成了系缆桩。本可以把钓索固定死的。可那样它会挣断钓索。我得尽量牵制住它，它要线的时候再放给牠。谢天谢地，它还在游，没有往下钻。"

【229】What I will do if he decides to go down, I don't know. What I'll do if he sounds and dies I don't know. But I'll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.  
【229】要是它决意下潜，我该怎么办？要是它突然下潜死掉，我该怎么办？但我总会想出办法的。能做的事还多着呢。

【230】He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the North-West.  
【230】他把钓索抵在背上，盯着它斜没水中的弧度，看着小船持续向西北方漂去。

【231】This will kill him, the old man thought. He can't do this forever. But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back.  
【231】这会要了它的命，老人想。它不可能永远这样下去。然而四个钟头后，那鱼依然拖着小船，稳稳地游向远海，老人也依旧把钓索勒在背上，纹丝不动地支撑着。

【232】"It was noon when I hooked him," he said. "And I have never seen him."  
【232】"我是中午钓上它的，"他说。"可始终没见着它。"

【233】He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.  
【233】他在钓住这条鱼前，就把草帽紧扣在头上，现在帽檐勒得额头生疼。他口渴难耐，便双膝跪地，小心避免扯动钓索，尽量挪向船头，单手够到水瓶。他拧开瓶盖抿了一小口，随后靠在船头休息。他坐在卸下的桅杆和船帆上，竭力放空思绪，只是默默忍耐。

【234】Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn't maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.  
【234】他回头望去，已看不见陆地的踪影。这没什么大不了，他想。我总能借着哈瓦那的灯火返航。离日落还有两小时，说不定在那之前它就会浮上来。如果不行，或许它会随着月亮现身。若还不行，也许日出时它会露面。我没有抽筋，浑身是劲。是它嘴里咬着钩子呢。可什么样的鱼能这样拖拽啊。它准是用嘴死死咬住了钓线。真希望能看见它。哪怕只看一眼也好，让我知道要对付的究竟是什么。

【235】The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man's sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.  
【235】就老人通过观察星象所能判断的，那条鱼整夜都没有改变航向和方向。太阳落山后天气转冷，老人背上、胳膊上和衰老双腿上的汗水都冷冰冰地干了。白天时，他把盖鱼饵箱的麻袋摊在阳光下晒干。日落之后，他将麻袋系在脖子上，让袋身垂在背后，又小心翼翼地将它塞进此刻横贯肩头的钓索下面。麻袋垫着钓索，他还发现可以俯身靠在船头，这样姿势几乎称得上舒适。实际上这种姿态只是稍微不那么难以忍受，但他却认为几乎算得上舒服了。

【236】I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as he keeps this up.  
【236】"我奈何不了它，它也奈何不了我，"老人想。只要它一直这样坚持下去，局面就不会改变。

【237】Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish's course held true I must see it for many more hours. I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing stupid.  
【237】有一次他站起身，隔着船舷向外小便，抬头望望星辰，又核对航向。钓索从他肩头笔直垂入水中，在水里映出一道磷光。此刻他们的速度放慢了些，哈瓦那的灯火也不那么明亮了，他知道海流正把他们带往东边。他想，要是哈瓦那的灯火都看不见了，我们一定是更往东去了。因为鱼要是还按原来的路线游，准能望见灯火好几个钟头。不知道今天的棒球大联赛结果如何，他想。干这行要是有台收音机才美呢。接着他又想，还是别想这个了，专心干手头的活儿吧。可千万别干蠢事。

【238】Then he said aloud, "I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this."  
【238】然后他出声说道："真希望那孩子在这儿。来帮帮我，也让他见识见识。"

【239】No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to himself.  
【239】人老了就不该孤零零的，他想。可这又避免不了。我得记着趁金枪鱼没坏就吃掉，好保持体力。记住，不管多不想吃，早上一定得把它吃了。记住啊，他对自己说。

【240】During the night two porpoise came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.  
【240】夜间有两条海豚游到船边，他听见它们翻腾和喷水的声音。他能分辨雄豚喷水的喧闹与雌豚叹息般的轻吹。

【241】"They are good," he said. "They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish."  
【241】"它们真好，"他说。"它们嬉戏、逗趣，相亲相爱。它们和飞鱼一样，都是我们的兄弟。"

【242】Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?  
【242】这时他开始怜悯起那条上钩的大鱼来。它真了不起，真奇特，谁知道它有多大年纪呢，他想。我从未钓到过这么强壮的鱼，也没见过行为这么奇特的鱼。也许它太聪明了，不愿跳出水来。它只要一跳或猛冲，就能要了我的命。不过它可能之前被钓过多次，知道该怎么搏斗。它不会知道对手只有一个人，更不知道是个老头。可它是多么了不起的鱼啊，如果肉质好，在市场上能卖多好的价钱啊。它像雄鱼那样吞饵，像雄鱼那样拉拽，搏斗时毫不惊慌。不知道它是否有什么计划，还是像我一样走投无路了？

【243】He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy's aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.  
【243】他想起那次钓到一对马林鱼中的一条。雄鱼总是让雌鱼先吃食，上钩的正是那条雌鱼，它疯狂挣扎，惊慌绝望，很快就筋疲力尽了。雄鱼始终陪伴在侧，它穿过钓线，在水面绕着雌鱼游动。它挨得那么近，老人生怕它镰刀般锋利、大小形状都酷似镰刀的尾巴会割断钓线。老人用鱼叉制住雌鱼，抓住它砂纸般粗糙的长嘴，用木棒猛击它的头顶，直到它银白的身体泛起镜背般的色泽，然后在男孩帮助下把它拖上船。这时雄鱼仍在船边徘徊。当老人清理钓线准备鱼叉时，雄鱼突然在船边高高跃起，想看清雌鱼的下落，随后展开淡紫色的胸鳍——那对宛如翅膀的宽大鳍片，露出全身淡紫色的条纹，深深潜回水中。它真美啊，老人回忆着，它始终没有离去。

【244】That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.  
【244】那是我见过他们最悲伤的模样，老人心想。男孩也很难过，我们请求了她的原谅，然后迅速结果了她。

【245】"I wish the boy was here," he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.  
【245】"但愿男孩在这儿，"他出声说道，身子抵住船头弧形的木板，通过斜挎在肩头的钓线，感受那条大鱼稳健地游向它自己选定的方向。

【246】When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the old man thought.  
【246】老人想着，曾几何时，由于我的背叛，他不得不做出抉择。

【247】His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all people in the world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to help either one of us.  
【247】他的选择是待在远离所有陷阱、圈套和背叛的幽暗深水处。而我的选择是去那里找他，远离尘世所有人。远离这世上所有人。如今我们联结在一起，从正午起便是如此。再没人能帮我们任何一个了。

【248】Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.  
【248】也许我本不该当个渔夫，他想。但这是我命中注定的事。天亮后我一定得记得把金枪鱼吃掉。

【249】Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff. In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line. There were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connected.  
【249】黎明前的某个时刻，有东西咬住了他身后的某个钓饵。他听见竿子断裂的声音，钓线开始飞速从船沿滑出。黑暗中他抽出鞘刀，将鱼的全部拉力转移到左肩上，身体后仰，在船沿的木头上割断了钓线。接着他又割断离自己最近的那根线，在黑暗中将备用线圈的松散末端牢牢系紧。他单手娴熟地操作着，用脚踩住线圈，在收紧绳结时固定它们。现在他有了六卷备用钓线——被割断的两个钓饵各贡献两卷，被鱼拖走的那个钓饵也有两卷，它们全都连在一起了。

【250】After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cordel and the hooks and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I hook some fish and it cuts him off? I don't know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.  
【250】天亮后，他心想，我要回头处理四十英寻深处的鱼饵，把它也割掉，接上备用的钓线。我会损失两百英寻优质加泰罗尼亚钓绳，还有那些鱼钩和接钩绳。这些都能补上。可要是我钓到鱼时被它咬断线，谁能代替这条鱼呢？刚才咬饵的不知是什么鱼。可能是枪鱼，或是剑鱼，再不然就是鲨鱼。我根本没来得及感受它。不得不太快甩掉它了。

【251】Aloud he said, "I wish I had the boy."  
【251】他出声说道："真希望那孩子在这儿。"

【252】But you haven't got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.  
【252】可你身边没有孩子，他心想。你只有自己，现在最好摸黑回到最后那根钓线处，不管天黑不黑，割断它再接上两盘备用钓线。

【253】So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.  
【253】于是他动手了。在黑暗中这很困难，有次大鱼猛然一冲，把他脸朝下拽倒，眼睛下方划了道口子。鲜血顺着脸颊流下一小段距离，但还没到下巴就凝结变干了。他挪回船头，倚着木板休息。他调整麻袋，小心地理着钓线，让它换到肩膀上另一处位置，用肩膀固定住钓线后，他仔细感受着鱼的拉力，又用手试探小船在水中的行进速度。

【254】I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.  
【254】不知它为何突然猛冲，他想。钓线准是在它隆起的巨大背脊上滑脱了。它的背肯定没我的这么疼。但不管它多厉害，总不能永远拖着这条船。现在所有可能惹麻烦的东西都清理掉了，我还有大卷备用钓线；一个人能要求的也不过如此。

【255】"Fish," he said softly, aloud, "I'll stay with you until I am dead."  
【255】"鱼啊，"他轻声说道，声音刚好能听见，"我会陪着你，直到我死去。"

【256】He'll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man's right shoulder.  
【256】"他也会陪着我吧，"老人想着，等待天亮。此刻黎明前寒气逼人，他紧贴着木板取暖。只要那鱼撑得住，我就能奉陪到底，他暗忖。晨光初现时，钓线笔直地延伸入深水。小船平稳前行，当太阳第一缕光芒跃出海面时，正映在老人右肩上。

【257】"He's headed north," the old man said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring.  
【257】"它在往北游，"老人自语。海流会把我们远远冲向东边，他想。但愿它能随洋流转弯。那便说明它力竭了。

【258】When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.  
【258】太阳升高后，老人意识到大鱼并未疲乏。唯有一个好迹象：钓线的倾斜度显示它游得浅了些。这未必代表它会跃出水面，但也未尝不可能。

【259】"God let him jump," the old man said. "I have enough line to handle him."  
【259】"上帝啊，让它跳吧，"老人祈祷，"我有足够的钓线来应付。"

【260】Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.  
【260】也许我只要再把钓线绷紧一点，就能让他疼得跳起来，老人想。现在天亮了，就让他跳吧，这样他脊骨边的气囊就会充满空气，就没法沉到深水里去死了。

【261】He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.  
【261】他试着加大拉力，可钓线自从钩住那条鱼后就一直绷紧到快要断裂的临界点。当他后仰着身子拽拉时，感觉到钓线勒得生疼，心知不能再加力了。我绝不能猛拉，他想。每次猛拉都会扩大鱼钩造成的伤口，等它真跳起来时可能会甩脱钩子。不过有阳光照着，我感觉好多了，而且这次不用逆着阳光看鱼了。

【262】There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.  
【262】钓线上缠着黄色的马尾藻，老人知道这只会增加拖拽的阻力，但他反而感到高兴。正是这种黄色的湾流海藻，在夜里发出了那么多磷光。

【263】"Fish," he said, "I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends."  
【263】"鱼啊，"他说，"我非常爱你，也非常敬重你。但在今天结束之前，我定要取你性命。"

【264】Let us hope so, he thought.  
【264】但愿如此吧，他心想。

【265】A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very low over the water. The old man could see that he was very tired.  
【265】一只小鸟从北面朝小船飞来。那是只莺，正贴着水面低飞。老人看得出它已疲惫不堪。

【266】The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man's head and rested on the line where he was more comfortable.  
【266】鸟儿落在船尾歇息，随后又绕着老人头顶盘旋，最后停在他觉得更舒适的那根钓索上。

【267】"How old are you?" the old man asked the bird. "Is this your first trip?"  
【267】"你多大啦？"老人问鸟儿，"这是你头回出远门吗？"

【268】The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.  
【268】鸟儿在他说话时望着他。他疲惫得连钓线都无力查看，纤细的脚爪紧抓着钓线摇摇欲坠。

【269】"It's steady," the old man told him. "It's too steady. You shouldn't be that tired after a windless night. What are birds coming to?"  
【269】"很稳当，"老人对它说。"稳当过头了。无风的夜晚过后，你不该这么疲倦。现在的鸟儿都怎么了？"

【270】The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.  
【270】准是那些老鹰，他想着，那些飞到海上来拦截它们的老鹰。但他没对鸟儿说这些，反正它也听不懂，而且很快就会见识到老鹰的厉害。

【271】"Take a good rest, small bird," he said. "Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish."  
【271】"好好歇会儿吧，小鸟儿，"他说。"然后像所有人类、鸟儿和鱼儿那样，进去碰碰运气。"

【272】It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.  
【272】这鼓励他继续说话，因为他的背在夜里变得僵硬，现在真的疼得厉害。

【273】"Stay at my house if you like, bird," he said. "I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend."  
【273】“小鸟，你愿意的话可以待在我这儿，”他说，“很抱歉我不能升起帆，趁着这点小风带你进去。但我正陪着一位朋友。”

【274】Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.  
【274】就在这时，鱼突然猛冲了一下，把老人拖倒在船头，要不是他稳住身子放了些钓线，差点就被拖下船去。

【275】The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go. He felt the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.  
【275】钓线猛地一扯时，小鸟已经飞走了，老人甚至没看见它离开。他用右手小心地摸着钓线，发现手在流血。

【276】"Something hurt him then," he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.  
【276】"刚才有什么东西伤到它了，"他大声说着，同时往回拉了拉钓线，想看看能否让鱼转向。但当钓线绷到快断的临界点时，他稳住力道，重新抵住钓线的拉力坐稳。

【277】"You're feeling it now, fish," he said. "And so, God knows, am I."  
【277】"你现在也尝到滋味了吧，鱼啊，"他说。"老天知道，我也一样。"

【278】He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company. The bird was gone.  
【278】他四下寻找那只鸟儿，此刻他真希望有它作伴。可鸟儿已经飞走了。

【279】You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.  
【279】你待的时间不长啊，老人想。但你要去的地方风浪更大，除非你飞抵岸边。我怎么会让那条鱼猛一拽就划伤我的手？我准是越来越糊涂了。要不就是当时只顾看那只小鸟，心里还想着它。现在我得专心干活，然后必须吃掉那条金枪鱼，免得待会儿没了力气。

【280】"I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt," he said aloud.  
【280】"要是那孩子在这儿就好了，还能弄点盐来，"他自言自语道。

【281】Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved.  
【281】他把钓索的重量移到左肩，小心翼翼地跪下，在海水里洗了洗手，把手在水里浸了一分多钟，望着血在水中漂散开去，小船移动时海水持续拍打着他的手。

【282】"He has slowed much," he said.  
【282】"它游得慢多了，"他说。

【283】The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.  
【283】老人本想把手在盐水里多浸一会儿，但他怕那鱼又突然猛拉钓索，于是站起身，振作精神，把手举到太阳下晒着。不过是钓索勒出的擦伤割破了皮肉。但这是手上最用得着的地方。他知道在这事结束之前他还需要这双手，他不愿还没开始就让手给割破。

【284】"Now," he said, when his hand had dried, "I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort."  
【284】"现在，"等手晾干后他说道，"我得吃掉那条小金枪鱼。用鱼钩就能把它够过来，在这儿舒舒服服地吃掉。"

【285】He knelt down and found the tuna under the stern with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.  
【285】他跪下来，用鱼钩在船尾找到那条金枪鱼，小心避开盘绕的钓线把它拖到身边。再次用左肩抵住钓线，左手和左臂撑住身体，他把金枪鱼从鱼钩上取下，将鱼钩放回原处。单膝压住鱼身，从鱼头后部到尾部纵向切下深红色的肉条。这些楔形肉条贴着脊骨一直切到鱼腹边缘。切完六条后，他把它们摊在船头木板上，在裤子上擦了擦刀，然后抓住鲣鱼尾巴提起残骸扔进海里。

【286】"I don't think I can eat an entire one," he said and drew his knife across one of the strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.  
【286】"我觉得吃不完整条，"他说着用刀划开其中一条肉。他能感受到钓线持续而沉重的拉力，左手开始抽筋。那粗重的钓线绷得紧紧的，他厌恶地瞪着它。

【287】"What kind of a hand is that," he said. "Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good."  
【287】"这算什么手啊，"他说，"要抽筋就抽吧。把自己变成爪子好了。对你没好处。"

【288】Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line. Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand's fault and you have been many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.  
【288】"来吧，"他想着，低头望向黑暗的水中那钓线的斜度。"现在吃了它，能让手更有劲。这不是手的错，你和这条鱼已经周旋好几个钟头了。但你不能永远跟它耗下去。现在把鲣鱼吃了吧。"

【289】He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not unpleasant.  
【289】他拿起一块鱼肉放进嘴里，慢慢地咀嚼着。味道并不难吃。

【290】Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt.  
【290】"要细细嚼烂，"他想着，"把汁水都吸出来。要是能加点酸橙汁，或是柠檬汁，再撒点盐，味道会更好。"

【291】"How do you feel, hand?" he asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis. "I'll eat some more for you."  
【291】"感觉怎么样，老伙计？"他问那只抽筋的手，它僵硬得几乎像尸僵一般。"我再替你多吃些。"

【292】He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin.  
【292】他把切成两半的鱼肉另一部分也吃了下去。仔细咀嚼后，将鱼皮吐了出来。

【293】"How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?"  
【293】"现在好些了吗，老手？还是说现在下判断为时过早？"

【294】He took another full piece and chewed it.  
【294】他又拿起一整块鱼肉咀嚼起来。

【295】"It is a strong full-blooded fish," he thought. "I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it."  
【295】"这是条血气旺盛的壮实鱼，"他想。"我运气好逮到它而不是鲯鳅。鲯鳅太甜腻。这鱼肉几乎不带甜味，精气神儿全在里头。"

【296】There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had some salt. And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I will be ready.  
【296】不过讲求实际总没错，他想。真希望有点盐。也不知道剩下的鱼肉会被太阳晒坏还是风干，所以尽管不饿，我还是全部吃掉为妙。这鱼很安静沉稳。我要把它全吃掉，这样就能做好准备。

【297】"Be patient, hand," he said. "I do this for you."  
【297】"耐心点，老伙计，"他说道。"我这么做都是为了你。"

【298】I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and keep strong to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.  
【298】我真希望能喂喂这条鱼，他想。它是我的兄弟。可我必须杀死它，得保持体力才能做到。他缓慢而认真地吃光了所有楔形的鱼肉条。

【299】He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers.  
【299】他直起身子，在裤子上擦了擦手。

【300】"Now," he said. "You can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense." He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.  
【300】"现在，"他说。"你可以松开钓线了，左手。我要单用右臂来对付它，直到你停止胡闹。"他把左脚踩在左手攥着的粗钓线上，仰身抵住后背承受的拉力。

### 2.4. 🎯 301-400

【301】"God help me to have the cramp go," he said. "Because I do not know what the fish is going to do."  
【301】"求上帝让我的抽筋快点好吧，"他说。"因为我不知道这条鱼接下来要干什么。"

【302】But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he thought. And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he will jump I can kill him. But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him forever.  
【302】但它看起来很平静，他想，而且按它的计划行事。可它的计划是什么呢，他想。我的计划又是什么？我必须根据它庞大的体型来临时调整我的计划。要是它跳起来，我就能杀死它。但它始终待在深水里。那我就陪它一直待下去。

【303】He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But it would not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs. But I do not want to open it now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord. After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and unite the various lines.  
【303】他把抽筋的手在裤子上摩擦着，想让手指舒展开来。可手就是张不开。也许太阳出来就好了，他想。也许等强韧的生金枪鱼肉消化后就会好。如果非要用它，我会强行掰开，不管付出什么代价。但现在我不想硬来。让它自己慢慢舒展恢复吧。毕竟昨夜为了解开和连接各条钓索，我把它折腾得太狠了。

【304】He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.  
【304】他眺望海面，明白此刻自己是多么孤独。但他能看见幽暗深水中折射的虹彩，钓线向前延伸，平静海面下奇异的涌动。信风将至，云层正在聚集，他望见一群野鸭掠过水面上空，在天空映出清晰剪影，继而模糊，复又清晰。他由此懂得：人在海上永远不会真正孤独。

【305】He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.  
【305】他想起有些渔夫乘着小船远离陆地就心生恐惧，深知在天气骤变的月份里这种恐惧不无道理。但此刻正值飓风季——若没有飓风侵袭，这反而是全年最佳的天气。

【306】If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you are at sea. They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he thought. The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no hurricane coming now.  
【306】若飓风将至，在海上总能提前数日从天空看出征兆，他想。岸上的人却察觉不到，因为他们不知该观察什么。陆地的存在想必也改变了云层的形态。但眼下并无飓风来袭的迹象。

【307】He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.  
【307】他凝视天空，积云如友善的冰淇淋堆叠，更高处是九月晴空映衬下的卷云，宛如纤细的羽毛。

【308】"Light brisa," he said. "Better weather for me than for you, fish."  
【308】"微风轻拂，"他说。"这天气对我比对你更有利，鱼啊。"

【309】His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.  
【309】他的左手仍然抽着筋，但他正慢慢把它舒展开来。

【310】I hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one's own body. It is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.  
【310】我恨抽筋，他想。这是身体对自己的背叛。因食物中毒而腹泻呕吐固然在人前丢脸，但抽筋——他用西班牙语想着"calambre"这个词——尤其当独自一人时，更是对自我的羞辱。

【311】If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he thought. But it will loosen up.  
【311】要是那孩子在这儿，就能替我揉揉，从前臂往下把它揉开，他想。不过它会自己松开的。

【312】Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.  
【312】他右手先感觉到钓索的拉力起了变化，随后才看见水面上斜伸的钓索突然一沉。接着，他一边用身子抵住钓索，一边快速有力地用左手拍打大腿，这时钓索开始缓缓向上斜升。

【313】"He's coming up," he said. "Come on hand. Please come on."  
【313】"它要上来了，"他说。"快动手啊，手。求你快些。"

【314】The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.  
【314】钓索持续而缓慢地上升，接着船头前方的海面鼓了起来，那鱼破水而出。它不停地向上腾跃，海水从它两侧倾泻而下。它在阳光下通体发亮，头部和背部呈深紫色，两侧的条纹在阳光里显得宽阔，泛着淡紫色的光。它的剑吻像棒球棍那般长，逐渐变细如击剑的佩剑，整个身躯完全跃出水面后，又像潜水员般流畅地重新没入水中。老人看见它那大镰刀般的尾巴没入水下，钓索随即开始飞速向外滑出。

【315】"He is two feet longer than the skiff," the old man said. The line was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.  
【315】"它比这小船还长两英尺呢，"老人说。钓索正飞速而平稳地向外滑去，大鱼并未惊慌。老人双手竭力拽住钓索，保持在即将绷断的临界点。他知道如果不能持续施压让大鱼慢下来，它可能会把整条钓索拖走并挣断。

【316】He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything now and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.  
【316】这是条了不起的鱼，我必须制服它，他想。绝不能让它意识到自己的力量，也不能让它知道狂奔起来会怎样。我要是它，此刻就会拼尽全力，直到某样东西绷断为止。不过感谢上帝，它们没我们这些杀它们的人聪明；尽管它们更高贵，更有能耐。

【317】The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.  
【317】老人见过许多大鱼。他见过不少重逾千磅的，这辈子也逮住过两条那么大的，但从没独自擒获过。如今独自一人，在望不见陆地的远海，他正与生平所见最大、甚至超出传闻尺寸的鱼僵持着，而他的左手仍像鹰爪般死死攥紧钓索。

【318】It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right hand. There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.  
【318】不过它会松开的，他想。它肯定会松开好帮助我的右手。有三样东西是兄弟：那条鱼和我的两只手。它必须松开。抽筋对它来说太丢脸了。鱼又慢了下来，以它惯常的速度游着。

【319】I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.  
【319】我真想知道它为什么跳起来，老人想。它跳起来简直像是为了向我展示它有多大。反正我现在知道了，他想。但愿我也能让它看看我是个什么样的人。不过那样它会看见这只抽筋的手。让它以为我是个比实际更了不起的汉子吧，我会做到的。我多希望我就是这条鱼啊，他想，用尽它所有的力量来对抗的，不过是我的意志和智慧。

【320】He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man's left hand was uncramped.  
【320】他舒服地靠在木板上，忍受着一阵阵袭来的痛楚，鱼稳稳地游着，小船在黑暗的水中缓缓前进。东边吹来的风掀起小浪，到了中午，老人抽筋的左手终于松开了。

【321】"Bad news for you, fish," he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders.  
【321】"这对你可不是好消息，鱼啊，"他说着把钓线在披着麻袋的肩膀上挪了挪位置。

【322】He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.  
【322】他虽安之若素，却仍备受煎熬，尽管他丝毫不肯承认这份苦楚。

【323】"I am not religious," he said. "But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgen de Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise."  
【323】"我不信教，"他说。"但我要念十遍天主经和十遍圣母经，保佑我逮住这条鱼，我发誓若能逮住它，一定去科布雷圣母院朝圣。这是誓言。"

【324】He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.  
【324】他开始机械地背诵祷词。有时倦意太浓，记不清经文，他就加快语速让祷词顺嘴溜出来。圣母经比天主经好念多了，他想。

【325】"Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen." Then he added, "Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish. Wonderful though he is."  
【325】"万福玛利亚，满被圣宠者，主与尔偕焉。女中尔为赞美，尔胎子耶稣并为赞美。天主圣母玛利亚，为我等罪人，今祈天主，及我等死候。阿们。"接着他又补了一句："圣母啊，求您让这条鱼死去。尽管它那么了不起。"

【326】With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of his left hand.  
【326】他做完祷告，感觉好受多了，但痛楚丝毫未减，或许还加剧了些。他靠在船头的木板上，开始机械地活动左手指关节。

【327】The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.  
【327】此刻阳光灼热，尽管微风正轻轻拂过。

【328】"I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern," he said. "If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don't think I can get anything but a dolphin here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won't be bad. I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big."  
【328】"最好把船尾那根细钓线重新装上鱼饵，"他自语道，"要是这鱼打算再耗上一夜，我就得补充体力，水壶里的水也不多了。这儿除了鲯鳅恐怕钓不到别的。不过趁新鲜吃倒也不差。真希望今晚能有飞鱼跳上船板。可惜没有灯光吸引它们。生吃飞鱼最美味，还省得动刀分割。现在我得保存每一分力气。天啊，我原先真不知道它竟这么大。"

【329】"I'll kill him though," he said. "In all his greatness and his glory."  
【329】"但我定要宰了它，"他宣告道，"任凭它如何雄伟壮观。"

【330】Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.  
【330】虽然这不公平，他想。但我要让他见识一个人能做什么，以及一个人能忍受什么。

【331】"I told the boy I was a strange old man," he said. "Now is when I must prove it."  
【331】"我告诉那孩子我是个古怪的老头，"他说。"现在正是我证明这一点的时候。"

【332】The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.  
【332】他上千次证明过这件事毫无意义。此刻他正在重新证明。每次都是新的开始，做这件事时他从不去想过去。

【333】I wish he'd sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the main thing that is left? Don't think, old man, he said to himself. Rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.  
【333】真希望他能睡着，这样我也能睡会儿，梦见那些狮子，他想。为什么狮子成了仅存的念想呢？别想了，老头，他对自己说。现在轻轻靠着船舷休息，什么都别想。他正在干活呢。你尽量少动弹吧。

【334】It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly.  
【334】时间渐入下午，小船依旧缓慢而平稳地行进。但此刻东风增添了拖拽的力道，老人随着细浪轻轻起伏，勒在背上的钓绳带来的痛感也变得舒缓而均匀。

【335】Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man's left arm and shoulder and on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.  
【335】下午时分，钓索又一次开始上浮。但那鱼只是继续在略高的水层游动。阳光灼烤着老人的左臂、左肩和后背，由此他判断鱼已转向东北方。

【336】Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark. Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.  
【336】既然已见过它一次，老人便能想象出这条鱼游动的模样：紫色的胸鳍像翅膀般张开，巨大的竖尾划破幽暗。不知道在那么深的地方它能看清多少，老人想着。它的眼睛大得很，而眼睛小得多的马都能在黑暗中视物。从前我在暗处也看得挺清楚。不是绝对的黑暗。但几乎像猫一样敏锐。

【337】The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.  
【337】阳光持续照射加上手指不断活动，此刻他的左手已完全不再抽筋，于是开始将更多拉力转移到左手上，同时耸动背部肌肉让钓绳造成的痛楚稍稍转移。

【338】"If you're not tired, fish," he said aloud, "you must be very strange."  
【338】"你要是没累乏的话，鱼啊，"他高声说，"那你可真不可思议啦。"

【339】He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran Ligas, and he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.  
【339】这时他感到非常疲乏，知道夜色就要降临，便竭力去想些别的事情。他想到了大联盟，在他心目中就是 Gran Ligas，他知道纽约扬基队正在迎战底特律老虎队。

【340】This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought. But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one's heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea.  
【340】"现在已经是第二天了，我还不知道 juegos（比赛）的结果，"他想。"但我必须有信心，必须对得起伟大的迪马乔，他即使脚后跟长了骨刺，做任何事也依然完美无缺。骨刺是什么玩意儿？"他问自己。"Un espuela de hueso（骨刺）。我们可没长过。这玩意儿会像斗鸡脚上的距铁扎进脚跟那么疼吗？我想我受不了那种痛苦，也不能像斗鸡那样，瞎了一只眼或两只眼都瞎了还继续战斗。人和伟大的鸟兽相比，真算不了什么。我还是宁愿做那只待在黑暗深海底的野兽。"

【341】"Unless sharks come," he said aloud. "If sharks come, God pity him and me."  
【341】"除非鲨鱼游来，"他自言自语道。"要是鲨鱼来了，愿天主怜悯它和我吧。"

【342】Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?  
【342】"伟大的迪马乔会像我守着这条鱼一样坚持这么久吗？"他想。"我相信他会的，甚至更久，因为他年轻力壮。况且他父亲也是个渔夫。但骨刺会不会让他疼得太厉害？"

【343】"I do not know," he said aloud. "I never had a bone spur."  
【343】"我不知道，"他大声说道。"我从没长过骨刺。"

【344】As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the time in the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other's hand down onto the table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro's face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro's hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them. The negro's shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps.  
夕阳西沉时，他想起卡萨布兰卡酒馆里那次扳手腕比赛来给自己打气。对手是码头最强壮的汉子——来自西恩富戈斯的高大黑人。他们肘抵桌面的粉笔线，前臂竖直，双手紧握，较量了一天一夜。双方都试图将对方的手压倒在桌面上。赌注不断加码，煤油灯下人们进出房间，他凝视着黑人粗壮的手臂、手掌和面庞。最初八小时后，每四小时更换一次裁判以便他们休息。他和黑人的指甲缝都渗出了血，彼此紧盯着对方的眼睛、手臂和拳头。赌客们穿梭于房间，靠墙坐在高脚椅上观战。木板墙漆成亮蓝色，煤油灯将人影投在墙上。黑人的巨影随微风摇曳的灯火在墙面上晃动。

【345】The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him. Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly three inches off balance. But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work.  
【345】整个晚上，胜负的几率来回摇摆，他们给那黑人灌了朗姆酒，还替他点烟。黑人喝了酒后，会试图爆发出惊人的力量，有一次他几乎让老人——那时还不算老，还是冠军圣地亚哥——失去平衡，偏差将近三英寸。但老人抬手又把局面扳平。那时他确信自己已击败了那个黑人，那是个优秀的男人，了不起的运动员。天亮时分，当赌客们要求判为平局而裁判摇头时，他猛然发力，将黑人的手一压再压，直到那只手抵在木板上。比赛从周日早晨开始，到周一早晨结束。许多赌客要求平局，因为他们得去码头装卸糖包，或去哈瓦那煤炭公司干活。否则所有人都想看到比赛分出胜负。但无论如何，他在大家上工前结束了比赛。

【346】For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match. After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.  
【346】此后很长一段时间里，人人都称他为"冠军"。那年春天还举行过一场复赛，但下注金额寥寥无几，他轻松取胜——因为首战就已击溃了那个西恩富戈斯黑人的斗志。后来他又参加了几场比赛，便彻底退出拳坛。他认定只要自己狠得下心，就能击败任何人；同时也认定拳击会对钓鱼的右手造成损害。他曾尝试用左手练习过几场，但这只叛徒般的左手总不听使唤，令他难以信任。

【347】The sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.  
【347】阳光现在会把它彻底晒干的，他想。除非夜里太冷，否则应该不会再抽筋了。不知今晚会有什么状况。

【348】An airplane passed over head on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish.  
【348】一架飞往迈阿密的飞机掠过天际，他望着机影惊起成群飞鱼。

【349】"With so much flying fish there should be dolphin," he said, and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.  
【349】"有这么多飞鱼，就该有鲯鳅，"他说着，身子往后仰靠在钓索上，想看看能不能把那鱼拽过来一点儿。但是不行，钓索照样紧绷着，上面抖动着水珠，都快迸断了。船缓缓地前进着，他紧盯着飞机，直到再也看不见为止。

【350】It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed, truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?  
【350】坐在飞机上一定非常奇妙，他想。不知道从那么高的地方往下看，海会是什么样子？要是飞得不太高，他们一定能清楚地看到鱼。我真想飞得慢些，在两百英寻的高度，从空中看看鱼。以前在捕龟船上，我待在桅顶横桁上，即便在那么高的地方也能看到不少。从那儿往下看，鲯鳅的颜色更绿，你能看清它们的条纹和紫斑，还能看见它们成群游动。为什么所有深色水流中的快游鱼都有紫色的背脊，而且通常还有紫色条纹或斑点呢？鲯鳅看上去当然是绿色的，因为它其实是金黄色的。但当它饿极了来吃食的时候，身子两侧就会像枪鱼一样显出紫色条纹。是因为愤怒，还是游得太快，才使这些条纹显露出来的呢？

【351】Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. It jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot. When the fish was at the stern, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stern. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.  
【351】天色将暗时，他们经过一大片随波起伏的马尾藻，那黄毯般的海藻在轻柔的海浪中摇曳，仿佛海洋正与毯下之物缠绵。就在此刻，一条鲯鳅咬住了他的细钓线。当那鱼儿第一次跃出水面时，老人在夕阳余晖中看清了它——通体如纯金般闪耀，在空中疯狂扭动拍打。惊恐万状的鲯鳅接连表演着杂技般的跳跃，老人趁机挪到船尾，右臂紧攥粗钓线蹲下身来，用左手将鲯鳅拖近，赤着的左脚每次都将收回的钓线踩住。当这尾鱼在船尾绝望地左冲右突时，老人探身越过船舷，把这条紫斑闪烁的金色大鱼拎了上来。鱼嘴痉挛般急促地啃咬着鱼钩，扁长的身躯连同头尾不断拍打小艇底板。老人便用棍棒猛击它金光灿灿的脑袋，直到那鱼颤抖着静止下来。

【352】The old man unhooked the fish, rebaited the line with another sardine and tossed it over. Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord.  
【352】老人把鱼从钩上取下，重新用一条沙丁鱼作饵抛进海里，然后慢慢挪回船头。他洗净左手，在裤子上擦干，接着将沉重的钓线从右手换到左手，又在海水里洗了洗手，同时望着太阳沉入海平面，以及那根粗钓线的斜度。

【353】"He hasn't changed at all," he said. But watching the movement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.  
【353】"它一点都没变，"他说。但观察着水流掠过手背的动向，他察觉到速度明显减缓了。

【354】"I'll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night," he said. "He's good for the night and so am I."  
【354】"我要把两支桨交叉绑在船尾，这样夜里能拖慢它，"他说。"它熬得过今夜，我也能。"

【355】It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he thought. I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.  
【355】他想，稍晚些再清理鲯鳅的内脏比较好，能保住鱼肉里的血水。可以等会儿同时处理这两件事——既清理鱼又绑好船桨当拖曳工具。现在最好让大鱼安静待着，日落时分别太惊动它。对所有的鱼来说，日落时分都是最难熬的。

【356】He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.  
【356】他让手悬在空中晾干，然后攥住钓线，尽可能放松身体，任自己被拉向前抵住船板，这样渔船承受的拉力就和他一样大，甚至更大。

【357】I'm learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he hasn't eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is easy.  
【357】我正在学习怎么对付它，他想。至少这部分已经掌握了。还要记住，它上钩后就没进食过，而它体型庞大需要大量食物。我吃完整条鲣鱼。明天我要吃那条鲭鱼。他管它叫"多拉多"。也许剖洗时该先吃些。那会比鲣鱼难以下咽。不过话说回来，没有哪件事是容易的。

【358】"How do you feel, fish?" he asked aloud. "I feel good and my left hand is better and I have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish."  
【358】"你感觉怎么样，鱼？"他出声问道。"我感觉不错，左手也好多了，还有够吃一天一夜的粮食。继续拖船吧，鱼。"

【359】He did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted. But I have had worse things than that, he thought. My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other. My legs are all right. Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.  
【359】他并非真觉得好受，因为勒进背脊的钓绳已超越疼痛，变成一种令他不安的麻木。但我经历过更糟的状况，他想。右手只是割破点皮，抽筋也止住了。双腿没问题。而且在食物储备方面我现在比它强。

【360】It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September. He lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could. The first stars were out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends.  
【360】此刻天已全黑，九月的太阳一落山，夜色便迅速笼罩下来。他靠在船头破旧的木板上，尽可能地休息着。第一批星星已经出现。他虽不认识参宿七的名字，但看见了它，知道很快群星都会现身，届时他便能与所有遥远的朋友相伴。

【361】"The fish is my friend too," he said aloud. "I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars."  
【361】"这条鱼也是我的朋友，"他大声说道。"我从未见过或听说过这样的鱼。但我必须杀死它。幸好我们不必去猎杀星星。"

【362】Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born lucky, he thought.  
【362】试想若有人每天必须追杀月亮，他思忖着。月亮会逃走的。但若有人每天必须追杀太阳呢？我们生来就是幸运的，他想。

【363】Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought. But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.  
【363】接着他为这条没东西可吃的大鱼感到难过，但这份怜悯并未动摇他杀死它的决心。它能养活多少人啊，他想。但他们配吃它吗？不，当然不配。以它行事的气度与庄严的仪态，这世上没人配享用它。

【364】I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.  
【364】这些事情我真搞不懂，他想。不过幸好我们不必去猎杀太阳、月亮或星星。以海为生，捕杀我们真正的兄弟，已经够受的了。

【365】Now, he thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits. I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong.  
【365】现在，他心想，我得考虑这拖力的问题。它有利也有弊。要是那鱼使劲挣扎，而船桨造成的拖力又恰到好处，小船就会失去全部轻盈——我可能会因此被拖走太多钓线，最终失掉它。船的轻盈固然延长了我们双方的痛苦，却也保障了我的安全，毕竟那鱼还有着从未施展过的惊人速度。无论如何，我得先剖开鲯鳅的肚子，免得它腐坏，再吃些鱼肉补充体力。

【366】Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment of the hook is nothing. The punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.  
【366】现在我要再休息一小时，等感觉它稳定沉着后，再回到船尾去干活并作出决定。这段时间里我可以观察它的动静，看它是否有任何变化。用桨是个好办法；但眼下到了求稳的时候。它仍是条大鱼，我看见鱼钩挂在它嘴角，而它一直紧闭着嘴。鱼钩的折磨算不了什么。饥饿的煎熬，以及它对抗着无法理解的事物，才是关键。现在休息吧，老家伙，让它挣扎去，直到你下次出手的时机来临。

【367】He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively. He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself.  
【367】他休息了约莫两小时——其实并无确切依据，因为月亮迟迟未升，他无法判断时间。这所谓的休息也只是相对而言。他仍用肩膀承受着鱼的拉力，不过他把左手搭在船头舷边，越来越依赖小船本身来分担这份抗力。

【368】How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small lurch he could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both hands.  
【368】要是能把钓索固定住就省事了，他想。可它稍一猛拽就会断。我必须用身体缓冲钓索的拉力，双手随时准备放线。

【369】"But you have not slept yet, old man," he said aloud. "It is half a day and a night and now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head."  
【369】"可你还没睡过觉呢，老家伙，"他出声说道。"已经过了半天一夜，现在又过了一天，你都没合眼。你得想个法子，趁它安稳平静时睡上一小会儿。要是不睡觉，脑子该糊涂了。"

【370】I'm clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.  
【370】我脑子清醒得很呢，他想。太清醒了。我和那些星星兄弟一样清醒。可我还是得睡觉。星星、月亮、太阳都要睡觉，就连大海在无潮无浪的平静日子里也会睡觉。

【371】But remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep.  
【371】但千万记得睡觉，他想。强迫自己睡去，还得给钓线想个简单可靠的法子。现在回去收拾那条鲯鳅吧。要是非睡不可的话，把船桨绑成拖曳装置太危险了。

【372】I could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.  
【372】不睡觉我也能撑下去，他对自己说。可那样太冒险了。

【373】He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do not want him to rest. He must pull until he dies.  
【373】他开始手脚并用地慢慢挪回船尾，小心翼翼地避免惊动那条鱼。它可能也半睡半醒着呢，他想。但我可不想让它休息。它必须一直拉拽，直到死去。

【374】Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear. He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish's head. Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail.  
【374】他回到船尾，转身用左手攥住勒在肩上的钓线，右手拔出刀子。此刻星光璀璨，他清楚地看见那条鲯鳅，便将刀刃插进鱼头，把它从船尾下方拖出来。他一只脚踩住鱼身，从肛门直剖到下颚尖端。随后他放下刀子，用右手掏出内脏，将鱼腹清理干净，又扯掉鱼鳃。他感觉鱼胃在手中沉甸甸滑溜溜的，便剖开来看。里面有两条飞鱼，新鲜硬挺。他把它们并排摆好，将内脏和鱼鳃抛入船尾外的海水中。这些下坠物在水中拖出一道磷光。鲯鳅此刻冰凉僵硬，在星光下呈现出麻风病人般的灰白色。老人右脚踩住鱼头，剥下一侧的鱼皮，接着把鱼翻过来剥另一侧，最后从头部到尾部将两片鱼肉分别片下。

【375】He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.  
【375】他把鱼尸推下船去，注视着水中是否泛起漩涡。只见那鱼缓缓下沉，留下一道光影。老人转身将两条飞鱼夹在两片鱼肉中间，收刀入鞘，慢慢挪回船头。钓索的重量压弯了他的脊背，右手还提着那条鱼。

【376】Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.  
【376】回到船头后，他把两片鱼肉摊在木板上，旁边摆着飞鱼。接着他换了肩膀承受钓索的位置，左手搭在船舷上再次攥紧钓索。他探出身去，就着海水冲洗飞鱼，感受水流掠过手掌的速度。剥鱼鳞时沾上的磷光还留在手上，他凝视着水流与磷光交织的模样。水流渐缓，当他的手背蹭过船板时，星星点点的磷光便脱落下来，缓缓漂向船尾。

【377】"He is tiring or he is resting," the old man said. "Now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep."  
【377】"它要么是累了，要么在休息，"老人自语道，"现在让我吃完这条鲯鳅，歇口气睡会儿吧。"

【378】Under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.  
【378】在繁星之下，随着夜色渐凉，他吃掉了半片海豚鱼排和一条处理过的飞鱼——内脏已清除，鱼头也被斩去。

【379】"What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked," he said. "And what a miserable fish raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes."  
【379】"煮熟的海豚鱼是多么美味啊，"他说道。"而生吃却如此难以下咽。以后出海我定要带上盐和酸橙。"

【380】If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still it was a lack of preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.  
【380】若有点脑子，我本该整天往船头泼水，晒干后就能得到盐了，他心想。不过那会儿直到日落时分我才钓到这条海豚。终究还是准备不足。好在现在我已细细咀嚼，倒也没反胃。

【381】The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone. It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.  
【381】东边的天空开始聚拢云层，熟悉的星辰接连隐没。此刻仿佛正驶入云雾构成的巨大峡谷，而风势已逐渐平息。

【382】"There will be bad weather in three or four days," he said. "But not tonight and not tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady."  
【382】"三四天后会有坏天气，"他说。"但不是今晚，也不是明天。趁现在鱼还平静安稳，老家伙，赶紧弄好钓索睡会儿吧。"

【383】He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.  
【383】他用右手紧紧攥住钓索，大腿抵住右手，整个身子都压在船头木板上。接着他把钓索往肩头挪低了些，用左手撑住。

【384】My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he thought. If it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used to punishment. Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right hand, and he was asleep.  
【384】只要右手撑着就能攥住钓索，他想。要是睡着时右手松了，钓索往外滑，左手就会把我惊醒。右手可真受罪。不过它早就习惯吃苦了。哪怕只睡二十分钟或半小时也好。他全身压着钓索蜷在船头，把重量都压在右手上，就这样睡着了。

【385】He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.  
【385】他梦见的不是狮子，而是一大群绵延八九英里的鼠海豚，正值交配季节，它们高高跃向空中，又落回自己跃起时在水面留下的涡洞里。

【386】Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.  
【386】接着他梦见自己躺在村里的床上，北风呼啸，他感到刺骨的寒冷，右臂也发麻了，因为他的头枕在手臂上而非枕头上。

【387】After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.  
【387】之后他开始梦见那片长长的黄色海滩，在昏暗的晨光中，他看见第一头狮子走下海滩，接着其他狮子也来了。他把下巴搁在船头的木板上，那里停泊着他的小船，晚间的离岸微风吹拂着，他等待着看是否会有更多狮子出现，内心充满喜悦。

【388】The moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.  
【388】月亮升起已久，但他仍在沉睡，大鱼稳稳地拉着小船，驶入云层形成的隧道中。

【389】He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.  
【389】他猛然惊醒，右拳正撞向自己的面颊，钓绳从右手火辣辣地窜出去。左手已经完全麻木，但他仍用右手拼命刹住飞窜的钓绳。终于左手摸到了绳索，他便仰身抵住钓绳，此刻绳子灼烧着他的后背和左手，全部拉力都落在左手上，勒得皮开肉绽。他回头望见绳圈正平稳地放出。就在这时，大鱼腾空跃起，海面轰然迸裂，继而沉重地砸落。它一次又一次地跳跃，小船虽被拖得飞驰，钓绳仍在飞速滑出。老人不断将钓绳绷到断裂的临界点，一次次挑战着极限。他被死死拽倒在船头，脸颊贴着那片切好的鲯鳅肉，动弹不得。

【390】This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it.  
【390】这就是我们等待的时刻，他想。现在让我们来见个分晓吧。

【391】Make him pay for the line, he thought. Make him pay for it.  
【391】得让它为钓绳付出代价，他想。必须让它付出代价。

【392】He could not see the fish's jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.  
【392】他看不见鱼的跳跃，只听见海面被撕裂的声响和它坠落时的沉重拍水声。钓线飞速抽离，将他的双手割得血肉模糊，但他早料到会如此，便竭力让钓线在长茧的部位摩擦，不让它滑进掌心或割伤手指。

【393】If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the boy were here.  
【393】要是那孩子在这儿，他会把钓线卷浸湿的，他想。是啊。要是那孩子在这儿。要是那孩子在这儿就好了。

【394】The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more slowly all the time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.  
【394】钓线不断向外抽离，但此刻速度渐缓，老人正迫使那鱼为每一寸钓线付出代价。现在他把头从船板上抬起，摆脱了被脸颊压碎的那片鱼肉。接着他跪起身子，再慢慢站直。他仍在放线，但速度越来越慢。他挪回能用脚触到那堆看不见的钓线圈的位置。钓线还剩下许多，此刻那鱼不得不拖着所有新放出钓线在水中的摩擦力前行。

【395】Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.  
【395】是的，他想。现在它已跳跃了十多次，背上的气囊灌满了空气，无法再潜入深海死在我够不着的地方。它很快会开始打转，那时我必须制服它。不知是什么让它突然如此惊慌？是饥饿让它不顾一切，还是夜间被什么东西吓着了？也许它突然感到了恐惧。可它是那样一条沉着健壮的鱼，看起来无所畏惧又充满自信。真奇怪。

【396】"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man," he said. "You're holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle."  
"老头儿，你自己可得无所畏惧、信心十足才行，"他说道。"你又把它拽住了，可就是收不上来。不过它很快就得打转了。"

【397】The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He's headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.  
【397】老人用左手和肩膀夹住他，俯身用右手舀水冲洗脸上压烂的海豚肉。他怕那腥味会让自己作呕，吐了就会丧失力气。洗净脸后，他把右手伸到船舷外浸洗，然后让手泡在海水里，望着日出前的第一缕曙光。他几乎在往东走，老人想。这说明它累了，正随洋流漂游。很快它就得打转。那时我们真正的较量才开始。

【398】After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it. "It is not bad," he said. "And pain does not matter to a man."  
【398】估摸右手泡得够久了，他抽出手来端详。"还不算糟，"他说。"疼痛对男子汉算不得什么。"

【399】He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.  
【399】他小心翼翼地握住钓线，避免它卡进任何新割的伤口里，同时调整身体重心，好把左手伸到小船另一侧的海水中。

【400】"You did not do so badly for something worthless," he said to his left hand. "But there was a moment when I could not find you."  
【400】"你这没用的东西倒也不算太差劲，"他对自己的左手说，"不过刚才有阵子我找不着你。"

### 2.5. 🎯 401-500

【401】Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again let the line cut him off.  
【401】为什么我就不能生来有双好手呢？他想。也许是我没把那只手训练好的过错。可天知道它有过多少学习的机会。不过它夜里表现得还不赖，只抽筋过一次。要是再抽筋，就让钓线把它勒断吧。

【402】When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can't, he told himself. It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it. I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment. You're stupid, he told himself. Eat the other flying fish.  
【402】想到这里，他意识到自己头脑不太清醒，觉得应该再嚼点鲯鳅肉。但不行，他对自己说。头晕总比呕吐耗光体力强。况且我知道脸扑在上面过，吃了也留不住。还是留着应急吧，等它变质再说。现在靠吃东西补充体力已经太迟了。你真蠢，他对自己说。把另一条飞鱼吃了吧。

【403】It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.  
【403】鱼饵就在那儿，已收拾干净准备妥当，他用左手拾起鱼饵吃了起来，仔细咀嚼着鱼骨，连鱼尾都吃得一干二净。

【404】It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought. At least the kind of strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.  
【404】这比几乎所有鱼都更有营养，他想。至少能提供我所需的那种力量。现在我已竭尽所能，他想。让它开始打转吧，让搏斗来临吧。

【405】The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.  
【405】自他出海以来，太阳第三次升起时，大鱼开始打转了。

【406】He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.  
【406】从钓线的倾斜度还看不出鱼在打转。现在判断为时过早。他只是感觉到钓线的拉力微微松弛，便开始用右手轻轻收线。和往常一样，钓线绷紧了，但就在即将断裂的临界点，钓线突然开始回收。他将肩膀和脑袋从钓线下抽出来，开始平稳而轻柔地收线。他双手交替摆动，尽量用身体和腿部的力量来拉拽。随着收线的摆动，他那双老腿和肩膀有节奏地转动着。

【407】"It is a very big circle," he said. "But he is circling."  
【407】"这是个很大的圈子，"他说。"但它正在绕圈。"

【408】Then the line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.  
【408】接着钓索再也收不进来了，老人紧握着它，直到看见阳光下钓索上迸溅的水珠。随后钓索开始往外溜，老人跪下来，极不情愿地让它缓缓滑回幽暗的海水。

【409】"He is making the far part of his circle now," he said. I must hold all I can, he thought. The strain will shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.  
【409】"它现在正绕到圈子的远端，"他说。我必须尽可能撑住，他想。每次拉力都会让它的圈子缩小些。或许再过一个钟头我就能见到它。眼下我得稳住它，然后宰了它。

【410】But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.  
【410】但大鱼仍持续缓慢地绕圈，两小时后老人已汗流浃背，累到骨子里。不过此刻圈子已小得多，从钓索倾斜的角度能看出，鱼一边游动一边在不断上浮。

【411】For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.  
【411】老人眼前已有一个小时不断浮现黑点，咸涩的汗水腌得他眼睛生疼，还渗入眉骨和额头的伤口。他对这些黑点并不畏惧。这般紧绷着钓线时，出现这种情况实属平常。但两次袭来的眩晕感却让他心头发慌。

【412】"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this," he said. "Now that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I'll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now."  
【412】"我可不能在这么条鱼面前丢脸送命，"他自语道，"既然已经把它引得这么漂亮，求天主保佑我撑住。我本该念百遍天主经和圣母经的，但现在实在念不了。"

【413】Consider them said, he thought. I'll say them later.  
【413】就当已经念过了吧，他想。回头再补上。

【414】Just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.  
【414】就在此刻，他双手攥着的钓线突然猛烈震颤。来势又急又猛，沉甸甸地扯动着。

【415】He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he thought. That was bound to come. He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.  
【415】他正用鱼叉敲打金属引线，老人心想。这是迟早的事。他不得不这么做。虽然这可能会让鱼跃出水面，但我宁愿它现在继续绕圈。鱼必须跳跃才能呼吸空气。但每次跳跃都会扩大钩伤的口子，它可能因此甩脱鱼钩。

【416】"Don't jump, fish," he said. "Don't jump."  
【416】"别跳啊，鱼。"他说。"别跳。"

【417】The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a little line.  
【417】鱼又多次撞击金属线，每次摇头摆尾时，老人就稍稍放出些钓线。

【418】I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But his pain could drive him mad.  
【418】必须让它的疼痛保持现状，老人想。我的疼痛不要紧。我能控制自己的疼痛。但它的疼痛会把它逼疯的。

【419】After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again. The old man was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.  
【419】过了片刻，那鱼不再撞击铁丝，又开始缓缓绕圈。老人此刻正稳步收回钓线。但他又感到一阵眩晕，便用左手舀起海水淋在头上，接着又淋了些，揉搓着后颈。

【420】"I have no cramps," he said. "He'll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don't even speak of it."  
【420】"我没抽筋，"他说。"它马上就会浮上来，我能撑住。你必须坚持住。连提都别提这事。"

【421】He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again. I'll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.  
【421】他跪在船头，暂时又把钓线背在背上。现在它往外绕圈时我就休息，等它转回来时再站起来对付它，他暗自决定。

【422】It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.  
【422】在船头歇着让鱼自己绕一圈而不收线，这诱惑实在太大。但当钓线绷紧显示鱼儿转向朝船游来时，老人立即起身开始扭动身体左右拉扯，把能收回的钓线尽数绞了回来。

【423】I'm tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.  
【423】我从未如此疲惫过，他想，现在信风又起了。不过这正好能助我把鱼带回去。我太需要这风了。

【424】"I'll rest on the next turn as he goes out," he said. "I feel much better. Then in two or three turns more I will have him."  
【424】"等它下次转向外游时，我就歇会儿，"他说。"现在感觉好多了。再转两三圈，我就能制服它。"

【425】His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.  
【425】草帽滑到后脑勺，随着鱼线传来的拉力，他感觉到大鱼正在转向，便顺势跌坐在船头。

【426】You work now, fish, he thought. I'll take you at the turn.  
【426】现在该你出力了，鱼啊，他想。等你转向时我就收服你。

【427】The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home.  
【427】海面已上涨许多。但这阵和风正利于返航，他必须借助它回家。

【428】"I'll just steer south and west," he said. "A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island."  
【428】"我只需向西南方向航行，"他说道。"人在海上永远不会迷路，况且这是个狭长的岛屿。"

【429】It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.  
【429】就在第三次转向时，他初次望见了那条鱼。

【430】He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length.  
【430】最初映入眼帘的是一道黑影，那影子从船底缓缓游过，其长度之巨令他难以置信。

【431】"No," he said. "He can't be that big."  
【431】"不，"他说。"它不可能有这么大。"

【432】But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.  
【432】但那条鱼确实如此巨大，在这一圈游动结束时，它浮出水面，离小船仅三十码远，老人看见它的尾巴露出水面。那尾巴比一把大镰刀的刀刃还要高，在深蓝色的海面上呈现出极浅的淡紫色。当鱼贴着水面游动时，老人能看清它庞大的身躯和周身环绕的紫色条纹。它的背鳍向下收拢，巨大的胸鳍像翅膀般张开。

【433】On this circle the old man could see the fish's eye and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.  
【433】这一圈里，老人能看见鱼的眼睛和两条绕着它游动的灰色吸盘鱼。有时它们吸附在它身上，有时突然窜开，有时又在它的阴影里悠闲游动。它们都有三英尺多长，快速游动时全身扭动如鳗鱼。

【434】The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.  
【434】老人此刻汗流浃背，但这并非只因阳光。每当大鱼平静地绕圈时，他都在收紧钓线，确信再绕两圈就有机会投出鱼叉。

【435】But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn't try for the head. I must get the heart.  
【435】但我必须引它靠近，再靠近，再靠近，他想。不能瞄准头部，必须直取心脏。

【436】"Be calm and strong, old man," he said.  
【436】"冷静些，再使把劲，老家伙，"他对自己说。

【437】On the next circle the fish's back was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.  
【437】鱼再次打转时背脊露了出来，不过离小船还是远了点。再转一圈时距离依旧稍远，但鱼身出水更高了，老人确信只要再收回些钓线，就能把它拽到船边。

【438】He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.  
【438】他早已备好鱼叉，那卷细绳盘在圆篮里，绳头牢牢系在船头的系缆桩上。

【439】The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.  
【439】那鱼此刻正沿着它的环形路线游来，姿态安详而优美，只有巨大的尾鳍在摆动。老人使出浑身解数想把它拉得更近些。有那么一瞬间，鱼身微微倾斜，随即又挺直身躯，开始了新一轮的盘旋。

【440】"I moved him," the old man said. "I moved him then."  
【440】"我拉动它了，"老人说。"刚才我确实拉动它了。"

【441】He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I'll pull him over.  
【441】此刻他又感到眩晕，但仍竭尽全力拽住这条大鱼。我拉动它了，他心想。也许这次能把它拽过来。加把劲啊，手，他默念着。挺住，腿。为我坚持住，脑袋。你可从没掉过链子。这次我一定要把它拽过来。

【442】But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.  
【442】可当他使出吃奶的力气，在鱼尚未靠近时就早早发力，用尽全力拖拽时，那鱼只是被拉偏了方向，随即又摆正身子游开了。

【443】"Fish," the old man said. "Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?"  
“鱼啊，”老人说。“鱼啊，你横竖都得死。你非得把我也害死吗？”

【444】That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You're good for ever.  
【444】这样下去什么都干不成，他想。他口干舌燥说不出话，但此刻却够不到水。这次我必须把它拉到船边来，他想。我撑不了几个回合了。不，你还能撑，他对自己说。你永远都能撑下去。

【445】On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.  
【445】在下一轮较量中，他几乎就要得手。但那鱼再次挺直身子，缓缓游走了。

【446】You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.  
【446】你这是在要我的命啊，鱼，老人想。但你有这个权利。兄弟啊，我从没见过比你更庞大、更美丽、更沉着、更高贵的东西了。来吧，杀死我吧。我不在乎谁杀死谁。

【447】Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.  
【447】现在你脑子开始犯糊涂了，他想。你必须保持头脑清醒。保持清醒，像个男子汉那样忍受痛苦。或者像条鱼那样，他想。

【448】"Clear up, head," he said in a voice he could hardly hear. "Clear up."  
【448】"清醒点，脑袋，"他用几乎自己都听不见的声音说道。"清醒点。"

【449】Twice more it was the same on the turns.  
【449】在转弯处又发生了两次同样的情况。

【450】I do not know, the old man thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it once more.  
【450】我不知道，老人想。每次他都差点觉得自己要垮了。我不知道。但我要再试一次。

【451】He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.  
【451】他又试了一次，当他把鱼拉转方向时，感觉自己快撑不住了。那鱼却重新摆正身子，又缓缓游开，巨大的尾巴在空中划着弧线。

【452】I'll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.  
【452】"我再试一次，"老人承诺道，尽管此刻他的双手已绵软无力，视线也只能断断续续地看清东西。

【453】He tried it again and it was the same. So, he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try it once again.  
【453】他再次尝试，结果依旧。于是他想着，还没开始就感到力不从心；我要再试最后一次。

【454】He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish's agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.  
【454】他将所有的痛楚、残存的气力与久违的骄傲统统凝聚起来，与鱼的垂死挣扎相抗衡。那鱼终于侧过身来，银紫色的斑纹在水中延展得又长又深又宽，仿佛永无止境。它轻柔地侧身游动，长嘴几乎触到小船的木板，开始缓缓绕过船身。

【455】The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish's side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man's chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.  
【455】老人丢下钓线，一脚踩住，将鱼叉举到力所能及的最高处，用上全身气力——还有他刚刚凝聚起的额外力量——朝着鱼身刺去，位置就在那高高耸起、齐人胸口的巨大胸鳍后方。他感到铁叉刺了进去，便压上全身重量继续推进。

【456】Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.  
【456】那鱼垂死挣扎，猛然高高跃出水面，展现出它全部的雄伟身躯和力量之美。它仿佛悬在老人和小船上方的空中，随后轰然坠入水中，溅起的浪花泼洒在老人身上，浸透了整条小船。

【457】The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish's shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep. Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.  
【457】老人感到头晕目眩，视线模糊。但他还是理顺了鱼叉绳，任其缓缓滑过自己血肉模糊的双手。待视线清晰时，他看见那鱼银白的肚皮朝天翻着。鱼叉柄从鱼肩斜刺而出，海水中正晕开它心脏涌出的鲜血——起初像深逾一英里的蓝海中的暗礁，继而如云霞般扩散开来。银光闪闪的鱼身静静随波漂浮。

【458】The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands.  
【458】老人用残存的视力仔细查看。随后他将鱼叉绳在船头系缆桩上绕了两圈，把额头抵在交叠的手背上。

【459】"Keep my head clear," he said against the wood of the bow. "I am a tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work."  
【459】"保持头脑清醒，"他对着弓形的船头木板说道。"我是个疲惫的老头子。但我杀死了这条鱼，它是我的兄弟，现在我得干些苦力活了。"

【460】Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.  
【460】现在我得准备好绳套和绳子，把它绑在船边，他想。就算我们有两个人，把船淹水来装载它，再把水舀出去，这小船也绝对装不下它。我必须准备好一切，然后把它拖过来绑牢，竖起桅杆，扬帆返航。

【461】He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.  
【461】他开始把鱼往船边拖，准备用绳子穿过鱼鳃从嘴里穿出来，把鱼头牢牢绑在船头。我想看看它，他想，摸摸它，感受它。它是我的财富，他想。但这不是我想感受它的原因。我觉得我摸到了它的心脏，他想。就在我第二次推鱼叉杆的时候。现在把它拖过来绑好，用绳套套住它的尾巴，再用一个套住它的身体中部，把它绑在小船上。

【462】"Get to work, old man," he said. He took a very small drink of the water. "There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over."  
【462】"干活吧，老头子，"他说。他啜了一小口水。"既然战斗结束了，现在有的是苦力活要干。"

【463】He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean nothing now. The boy and I will splice them when we are home.  
【463】他抬头望望天空，又眺望水中的鱼。他仔细端详着太阳。现在刚过正午不久，他想。信风也渐渐起来了。这些钓索现在都用不着了。等回家后，那孩子会和我一起把它们接起来的。

【464】"Come on, fish," he said. But the fish did not come. Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff up onto him.  
【464】"来吧，鱼啊，"他说。可那鱼偏不游过来。它反倒躺在海面上翻滚着，老人只好把小船划到它身边。

【465】When he was even with him and had the fish's head against the bow he could not believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish's gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man's hand with his fingers spread and the fish's eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a procession.  
【465】当船身与鱼并齐，鱼头抵着船头时，老人简直不敢相信它竟有这般大。他从系缆桩上解下鱼叉绳，穿过鱼鳃从嘴里拉出来，在它长剑般的上颌绕了一圈，又穿过另一边的鳃，再在上颌绕一圈，将双股绳子打个结，紧紧系在船头的系缆桩上。随后他割断绳子，走到船尾用套索拴住鱼尾。鱼身已从原先的紫银相间变成了纯银色，条纹和尾巴一样呈现出淡紫色。这些条纹比张开五指的人手还宽，鱼眼漠然如潜望镜的镜片，又似宗教游行队伍中的圣徒像。

【466】"It was the only way to kill him," the old man said. He was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He's over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?  
【466】"这是杀死它的唯一办法，"老人说。喝了水后他感觉好些了，知道自己不会垮掉，头脑也清醒了。照它现在的模样，至少有一千五百磅重，他想。说不定更重。如果去掉头尾和内脏还剩三分之二，按每磅三角钱计算？

【467】"I need a pencil for that," he said. "My head is not that clear. But I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly." I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it.  
【467】"我得用铅笔算算，"他说。"我脑子还没那么清楚。不过我想伟大的迪马乔今天会为我骄傲的。我虽然没有骨刺，但双手和后背实在疼得厉害。"不知道骨刺是什么玩意儿，他想。说不定我们长了骨刺自己都不知道。

【468】He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish's lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible. Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.  
【468】他把鱼牢牢地绑在船头、船尾和中间的座板上。鱼实在太大了，简直像在船边绑了条大得多的船。他割下一段钓索，把鱼的下颌和长嘴捆在一起，让鱼嘴张不开，这样船就能尽可能利索地航行。接着他竖起桅杆，用那根当鱼钩的棍子和下桁做成帆架，补丁累累的帆布鼓满了风，小船开始移动。他半躺在船尾，向西南方驶去。

【469】He did not need a compass to tell him where south-west was. He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff. There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.  
【469】他不需要罗盘也能辨明西南方向。只需感受信风的吹拂和船帆的牵引就够了。最好还是放根细钓线出去，装上勺子形假饵，弄点吃的喝的补充水分。但他找不到勺子，沙丁鱼也腐坏了。于是当船经过一片黄色马尾藻时，他用鱼钩将其勾起，抖落出藏在里面的小虾，它们纷纷落在小船的船板上。有十几只之多，蹦跳踢蹬得像沙蚤。老人用拇指和食指掐掉虾头，连壳带尾嚼着吃下。虾虽小，他却知道既营养又美味。

【470】The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it. Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever.  
【470】老人瓶里还剩两口水，吃完虾后他喝了半口。尽管条件简陋，小船仍航行得不错，他腋下夹着舵柄掌舵。他能看见那条鱼，只需看看自己的手，再感觉后背抵着船尾，就知道这一切真实发生过，并非梦境。有阵子他难受得厉害时，还曾怀疑这是场梦。后来看见鱼跃出水面，悬在天空中纹丝不动才坠落，他便确信其中必有玄妙，简直难以置信。当时他视线模糊，不过现在又看得和往常一样清楚了。

【471】Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.  
【471】此刻他明白大鱼确实存在，双手和背上的疼痛也并非幻觉。他想，手上的伤很快会愈合。我已把伤口里的血挤净，海水能治愈它们。这幽深海湾的海水是世上最灵验的良药。我只需保持头脑清醒。双手已完成了使命，我们配合得不错。鱼嘴紧闭，尾鳍笔直竖立，我们像兄弟般并肩航行。这时他的思绪开始混沌，不禁思忖：是它在拖我返航，还是我在引它归港？若是我拖着它走，答案自不待言。倘若这失去尊严的鱼躺在小船里，答案同样明了。但此刻他们并排绑着同行，老人想着：若它乐意，就让它带我回家吧。我不过是靠诡计占了上风，它对我可没有恶意。

【472】They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.  
【472】他们顺利航行着，老人将双手浸在咸涩的海水中，努力保持神志清明。积云高悬，其上还有足够的卷云，老人知道这微风将持续整夜。他不断望向那条鱼以确认它的存在。就在第一个小时过去后，鲨鱼来袭了。

【473】The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had taken.  
【473】这条鲨鱼绝非偶然出现。当那团暗红的血云在一英里深的海水中沉降弥散时，它便从深不可测的幽暗处浮了上来。它来势汹汹毫无顾忌，破开碧蓝的海面跃入阳光里，随后又坠回海中，循着血腥味开始追踪小船和大鱼留下的航迹。

【474】Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it, and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.  
【474】有时它会丢失气息的线索，但总能重新捕捉到蛛丝马迹，便继续沿着航线奋力疾游。这是条体型巨大的灰鲭鲨，天生具备与海洋中最快鱼类比肩的泳速，除了那张血盆大口外，通体堪称完美。

【475】His back was as blue as a sword fish's and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks. They were shaped like a man's fingers when they are crisped like claws. They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.  
【475】它的脊背蓝得像旗鱼，腹部银光闪闪，鱼皮光滑漂亮。除了此刻紧闭着的巨大颌部，它的体形完全像条旗鱼。它游得极快，高耸的背鳍破开水面，纹丝不动。在紧闭的双唇内部，八排牙齿全都向内倾斜。这些牙齿不像普通鲨鱼的锥形齿，而像人手指蜷曲成爪状时的模样，几乎有老人手指那么长，两侧都锋利如剃刀。这种鱼天生就以海中所有鱼类为食，它们游速快、体格壮、武器精良，所向无敌。此刻它嗅到更浓烈的血腥味，便加快速度，蓝色的背鳍划开水面。

【476】When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.  
【476】老人见它游来，明白这是条毫无畏惧、为所欲为的鲨鱼。他一边盯着鲨鱼逼近，一边备好鱼叉，系紧绳索。由于之前割下部分绳索绑鱼，剩下的绳子已经不长。

【477】The old man's head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in. It might as well have been a dream, he thought. I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe I can get him. Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your mother.  
【477】老人的头脑此刻清醒而坚定，他充满决心，却几乎不抱希望。他想，这好景恐怕难以持久。他望着鲨鱼逼近，又瞥了一眼那条大鱼。这简直像一场梦，他想。我无法阻止它攻击我，但或许我能制服它。尖吻鲭鲨，他想。让你娘倒大霉去吧。

【478】The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail. The shark's head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark's head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose. There were no such lines. There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.  
【478】鲨鱼飞速逼近船尾，当它咬住大鱼时，老人看见它大张的嘴和那双怪异的眼睛，利齿咔嚓一声嵌入鱼尾上方的肉里。鲨鱼的头露出水面，背脊正破水而出，老人听见大鱼的皮肉被撕裂的声响，他立刻将鱼矛朝鲨鱼两眼间的中线与鼻头后方直线的交汇处猛刺下去。其实根本不存在这样的线条。只有那沉重的蓝色尖头，大睁的双眼，以及咔嚓作响、向前突进、吞噬一切的颚。但那里正是脑部所在，老人击中了。他用血肉模糊的双手使尽全力刺出锋利的长矛。这一击不带希望，却充满决绝与彻骨的杀意。

【479】The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. The old man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a speed-boat does. The water was white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very slowly.  
【479】鲨鱼翻转过来，老人看见它的眼睛已没了生气，接着它又翻了个身，自行缠上了两道绳索。老人知道它已死透，但鲨鱼却不肯认命。随后，这鲨鱼背脊朝下，尾巴猛烈拍打，上下颚像铡刀般开合，像快艇似的破浪前进。它尾巴击水处白浪翻腾，当绳索绷紧时，它四分之三的躯体都高耸在水面上。随着绳索一阵颤动，最终啪地断裂。鲨鱼静静地浮在水面片刻，老人凝视着它。接着它便缓缓沉入深海。

【480】"He took about forty pounds," the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others.  
【480】"它叼走了约莫四十磅肉。"老人出声说道。它把我的鱼叉和整条绳子也带走了，他想着，现在我的鱼又在流血，还会引来别的掠食者。

【481】He did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were hit.  
【481】自大鱼被咬得残缺不全后，老人便不忍再看它。当鱼遭撕咬时，仿佛他自己也在遭受撕咬。

【482】But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen. And God knows that I have seen big ones.  
【482】但我杀死了那条袭击我大鱼的鲨鱼，他想着。而且它是我见过最大的灰鲭鲨。天知道我曾见过多少大家伙。

【483】It was too good to last, he thought. I wish it had been a dream now and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.  
【483】"这好景终究难持久啊，"他心想。"但愿此刻是场梦，我压根没钓到这条鱼，正独自躺在铺着报纸的床板上。"

【484】"But man is not made for defeat," he said. "A man can be destroyed but not defeated." I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more intelligent that he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.  
【484】"但人不是为失败而生的，"他说道。"一个人可以被毁灭，却不能被打败。"不过杀死这条鱼让我内疚，他想。现在厄运要来了，可我连鱼叉都没有。那条灰鲭鲨残忍强悍又狡诈。但我比它更聪明。也许未必，他想。也许我只是武器更精良些。

【485】"Don't think, old man," he said aloud. "Sail on this course and take it when it comes."  
【485】"别胡思乱想了，老家伙，"他出声说道。"沿着这条航线继续走，该来的总会来。"

【486】But I must think, he thought. Because it is all I have left. That and baseball. I wonder how the great DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no great thing, he thought. Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone spurs? I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.  
【486】可我不能停止思考，他想。因为这是我仅剩的东西了。除了思考就只剩棒球。不知道伟大的迪马乔要是知道我击中鱼脑的手法会作何感想？这没什么了不起，他想。谁都能办到。但你觉得我这对老手比骨刺的妨碍更大吗？我说不准。我的脚后跟除了那次游泳踩到黄貂鱼被蜇伤，导致小腿麻痹疼得死去活来之外，倒从没出过毛病。

【487】"Think about something cheerful, old man," he said. "Every minute now you are closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds."  
【487】"想点高兴的事儿吧，老家伙，"他说。"现在每分钟你都离家更近一步。少了四十磅的负担，船开起来更轻快了。"

【488】He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the current. But there was nothing to be done now.  
【488】他非常清楚驶入洋流中心后可能发生的情况。但现在已无计可施。

【489】"Yes there is," he said aloud. "I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars."  
【489】"不，有办法，"他大声说。"我可以把刀绑在一支桨柄上。"

【490】So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.  
【490】于是他一手夹着舵柄，一脚踩着帆索，就这么做了。

【491】"Now," he said. "I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed."  
【491】"现在，"他说。"我还是个老头。但我并非手无寸铁。"

【492】The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned.  
【492】微风正清爽，他航行得很顺利。他只盯着鱼的前半部分，心中又燃起些许希望。

【493】It is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe it is a sin. Do not think about sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no understanding of it.  
【493】不抱希望才愚蠢呢，他想。况且我认为这是种罪过。别想什么罪过了，他想。眼下要操心的事够多了，哪还顾得上罪过。再说我也弄不明白。

【494】I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.  
【494】我弄不明白，也不确定自己是否真信这个。杀死那条鱼或许是罪过。我想就算是为了活命和养活许多人，这终究是罪过。可照这么说，干什么都是罪过。别想什么罪过了。现在想这个太迟，何况有人拿了钱专门研究这个。让他们琢磨去吧。你生来就是渔夫，就像鱼生来就是鱼。圣佩德罗是渔夫，伟大的迪马吉奥的父亲也是渔夫。

【495】But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin. You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. It you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?  
【495】但他总爱思索与自己有关的一切事物，既然没有书报可读，也没有收音机，他就想得很多，而且不断思考着罪孽的问题。你杀死那条鱼不光是为了活命，也不光是为了卖钱买食物，他想。你杀死他是出于自尊，因为你是个渔夫。他活着时你爱他，死后你也爱他。如果你爱他，杀死他就不是罪过。或许反而是更大的罪过？

【496】"You think too much, old man," he said aloud.  
【496】"你想得太多了，老头。"他自言自语道。

【497】But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do. He is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything.  
【497】可你杀死那条灰鲭鲨时是乐在其中的，他想。它和你一样靠活鱼为生。它不是食腐动物，也不像某些鲨鱼那样只是游动的食欲。它美丽而高贵，无所畏惧。

【498】"I killed him in self-defense," the old man said aloud. "And I killed him well."  
【498】"我是自卫才杀死它的，"老人说出声来，"而且干得干净利落。"

【499】Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he thought. I must not deceive myself too much.  
【499】况且他想，世间万物都以某种方式彼此相杀。捕鱼既养活我，也在要我的命。那孩子让我活着，他想。我可不能自欺太甚。

【500】He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm and juicy, like meat, but it was not red. There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market. But there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew that a very bad time was coming.  
【500】他俯身从船舷外扯下一块被鲨鱼咬过的鱼肉，放在嘴里咀嚼着。他注意到鱼肉质地紧实，味道鲜美，多汁如兽肉，却非红色。肌理毫无粗纤维，他知道这能在市场上卖出最高价。但无法阻止血腥味在海水中扩散，老人明白最糟糕的时刻即将来临。

### 2.6. 🎯 501-600

【501】The breeze was steady. It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew that meant that it would not fall off. The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf-weed. He could not even see a bird.  
【501】微风持续吹拂，风向略转向东北，他知道这意味着风力不会减弱。老人极目远眺，既看不见帆影，也望不到船身或任何船只的烟迹。唯有飞鱼从船头两侧跃起，还有几簇黄色的马尾藻。他甚至连一只海鸟都看不见。

【502】He had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the two sharks.  
【502】他已航行了两个小时，在船尾歇息，偶尔嚼一口马林鱼的肉，试图养精蓄锐，这时他看见了那两条鲨鱼中的第一条。

【503】"Ay," he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.  
【503】"哎，"他大声说道。这个词无法翻译，或许它只是人无意识发出的声响，就像钉子穿透手掌钉进木头时不由自主的呻吟。

【504】"Galanos," he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail. They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they were closing all the time.  
【504】"灰鲭鲨，"他大声说。此刻他已看见第二片背鳍紧随着第一片露出水面，从那棕色的三角形背鳍和尾巴摆动的姿态，他认出这是铲鼻鲨。它们嗅到了血腥味，显得很兴奋，在极度饥饿的愚蠢驱使下，它们时而迷失气味时而重新嗅到，在亢奋中团团打转。但它们始终在逼近。

【505】The old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller. Then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it. He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain. Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white-tipped wide pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these sharks that would cut the turtles' legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.  
【505】老人把帆脚索系牢，卡住舵柄，然后抄起绑着刀子的桨。他尽量轻地举起来，因为双手已经痛得不听使唤。接着他张开又轻轻合拢手指，让它们松动些。他紧紧攥住桨，这样就能忍住疼痛而不致畏缩，同时盯着鲨鱼游来。此刻他已能看清它们那宽扁的铲形头颅和尖端发白的宽阔胸鳍。这是可恶的鲨鱼，散发着臭气，既是食腐者又是杀手，饥饿时连船桨和船舵都会咬。就是这些鲨鱼，会在海龟睡着时咬断它们的腿和鳍肢；若饿极了，哪怕人身上没有鱼血或黏液的气味，它们也会攻击水里的活人。

【506】"Ay," the old man said. "Galanos. Come on, Galanos."  
【506】"哎，"老人说。"加拉诺鲨。来吧，加拉诺鲨。"

【507】They came. But they did not come as the Mako had come. One turned and went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish. The other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten. The line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture, withdrew it, and drove it in again into the shark's yellow cat-like eyes. The shark let go of the fish and slid down, swallowing what he had taken as he died.  
【507】它们来了。但不像灰鲭鲨那样来势汹汹。一条鲨鱼转身钻到小艇底下不见了，老人能感觉到小艇在晃动，原来它在下面撕扯着大鱼。另一条用狭缝般的黄眼睛盯着老人，然后飞快地游近，半圆形的颚大张着，朝大鱼已被咬过的地方扑去。它褐色的头顶和背脊上清晰地露出钓线的痕迹，就在脑部与脊髓相连的位置。老人将绑在桨上的刀子刺进那个接合处，抽出来，又刺进鲨鱼猫一般的黄眼睛里。鲨鱼松开大鱼，滑入水中，临死前吞下了它咬下的那块肉。

【508】The skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in. The blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too. But the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish. The old man withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye. The shark still hung there.  
【508】小船仍在因另一条鲨鱼撕咬大鱼而摇晃，老人松开帆脚索，让船身横转，使鲨鱼从船底暴露出来。一看见鲨鱼，他就探身猛击。拳头只砸到厚实的皮肉，刀子几乎扎不进去。这一击不仅震痛了他的手，连肩膀也剧痛难忍。但鲨鱼迅速浮出水面，扁平的脑袋刚露出水面，鼻子还抵着鱼身时，老人就对准它头顶正中央狠狠捅去。他拔出刀刃，又朝同一部位再捅一刀。鲨鱼仍紧咬着大鱼不放，老人便刺向它的左眼。鲨鱼依旧死死咬住不放。

【509】"No?" the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain. It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. The old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark's jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said, "Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or maybe it's your mother."  
【509】“还不松口？”老人说着，将刀刃插进脊椎与脑髓之间的缝隙。这下容易多了，他感觉到软骨断裂的声音。老人调转船桨，把桨片卡进鲨鱼双颚之间撬开。他扭转刀刃，当鲨鱼终于滑脱时说道：“滚吧，加拉诺鲨。沉到一英里深的海底去。找你朋友作伴吧，说不定那是你娘。”

【510】The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.  
【510】老人擦净刀刃，放下船桨。他找到帆脚索，待风帆鼓满后，便驾着小船继续前行。

【511】"They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat," he said aloud. "I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong." He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed.  
【511】"它们至少吃掉了四分之一，而且都是最好的部位，"他出声说道。"真希望这是场梦，但愿我从没钓到它。鱼啊，我很难过。一切都搞砸了。"他停下动作，此刻不愿再看那条鱼。失血过多的鱼身随波浮沉，呈现出镜背般的银灰色，但条纹仍清晰可见。

【512】"I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish," he said. "Neither for you nor for me. I'm sorry, fish."  
【512】"我不该出海这么远的，鱼啊，"他说。"这对你对我都不好。对不起，鱼。"

【513】Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.  
【513】现在，他对自己说。检查绑刀的绳子有没有被咬断。然后把手料理好，因为麻烦还没结束。

【514】"I wish I had a stone for the knife," the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. "I should have brought a stone." You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
【514】"真该带块石头来磨刀，"老人检查完桨柄上的绳结后说道。"我早该备块磨刀石的。"你该带的东西多着呢，他想。可都没带啊，老家伙。现在不是想缺什么的时候，该想想用手头的东西能干什么。

【515】"You give me much good counsel," he said aloud. "I'm tired of it."  
【515】"你倒给我出了不少好主意，"他大声说。"我都听腻了。"

【516】He held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward.  
【516】他把舵柄夹在腋下，小船前进时，将双手都浸在海水里。

【517】"God knows how much that last one took," he said. "But she's much lighter now." He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea.  
【517】"天知道最后那条鲨鱼咬走了多少鱼肉，"他说。"不过船倒是轻快多了。"他不愿去想大鱼被咬得残缺不全的腹部。他知道鲨鱼每次猛撞上去，都会撕走一块肉，如今这鱼留下的血腥踪迹，就像海面上铺开的一条公路，会引来所有的鲨鱼。

【518】He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought. Don't think of that. Just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed much. There is nothing cut that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from cramping.  
【518】他想，这条鱼够一个人吃一整个冬天。别想这个了。休息一下，让手恢复过来，好保住剩下的鱼肉。现在水里血腥味这么重，我手上的血腥味根本不算什么。再说它们出血也不多。伤口都不在要紧的地方。流血说不定还能防止左手抽筋。

【519】What can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for the next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might have turned out well.  
【519】现在我能想什么呢？他想。什么也别想。我必须什么也不想，等着下一批鲨鱼来。他真希望这只是一场梦，他想。但谁知道呢？说不定结局会不错。

【520】The next shark that came was a single shovel-nose. He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into his brain. But the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.  
【520】下一条来袭的是条独行的铲鼻鲨。它像头冲向食槽的猪，如果猪的嘴能大得吞下人头的话。老人任它咬住鱼，然后把绑在桨上的刀子刺进它脑子。可鲨鱼翻滚时猛地一扭，刀身啪地断了。

【521】The old man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it now.  
【521】老人坐稳了掌舵。他甚至没去看那条大鲨鱼慢慢沉入水中，先是原样大小，继而变小，最后成了个小点。这景象往常总让老人着迷。但此刻他连看都没看一眼。

【522】"I have the gaff now," he said. "But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club."  
【522】"现在我有鱼钩了，"他说。"但这没什么用。我还有两支桨、舵柄和短棍。"

【523】Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.  
【523】现在它们打败我了，他想。我太老了，没法用棍子打死鲨鱼。但只要我还有桨、短棍和舵柄，我就要试试。

【524】He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.  
【524】他又把手浸入海水里。下午渐晚，除了大海和天空，他什么也看不见。天上的风比先前更大了，他希望很快就能看见陆地。

【525】"You're tired, old man," he said. "You're tired inside."  
【525】"你累了，老家伙，"他说。"你从里到外都累透了。"

【526】The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.  
【526】直到太阳快落山时，鲨鱼才再次袭击他。

【527】The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water. They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff swimming side by side.  
【527】老人看见褐色的鱼鳍正沿着大鱼在水中拖出的宽阔踪迹游来。它们甚至没有迂回搜寻气味，而是并排径直朝小船游来。

【528】He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stern for the club. It was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length. He could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were both galanos.  
【528】他卡住舵柄，系紧帆脚索，伸手到船尾下方摸那根棍子。那是从断桨上锯下来的桨柄，约莫两英尺半长。由于把手太粗，他只能用单手有效挥动。他右手紧握住棍子，活动着手腕，注视着逼近的鲨鱼。两条都是铲鼻鲨。

【529】I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head, he thought.  
【529】必须让第一条鲨鱼咬结实了，再打它的鼻尖或者直接敲头顶，老人想。

【530】The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark's broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.  
【530】两条鲨鱼紧逼过来，老人看见最近的那条张开大嘴，狠狠咬进银亮的鱼腹时，他高举木棍，用尽全力朝它扁平的脑门猛砸下去。棍子落下时，他感受到橡胶般的韧性，但也触到了坚硬的骨头。趁鲨鱼从鱼身上滑落的瞬间，他又对准它的鼻尖狠狠补了一记。

【531】The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness.  
【531】另一条鲨鱼来回游弋，此刻又张着血盆大口袭来。当它撞上大鱼并合拢双颚时，老人看见碎鱼肉从它嘴角泛白地溢出来。老人挥棍击打，却只砸中头部。那鲨鱼瞪着他，猛然撕下一大块肉。待它扭身吞咽时，老人再次抡棍砸下，却只击中它厚重如橡胶的躯体。

【532】"Come on, galano," the old man said. "Come in again."  
【532】"来吧，加拉诺鲨，"老人说，"再来啊。"

【533】The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.  
【533】鲨鱼猛冲过来，老人趁它合拢双颚时重重击中它。他竭尽全力高举木棍，结结实实地给了它一击。这次他感觉到棍子敲中了脑后的骨节，当鲨鱼迟缓地撕下一块鱼肉滑离鱼身时，他又在同一部位补了一记猛击。

【534】The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.  
【534】老人守候着鲨鱼再度来袭，但两条鲨鱼都没现身。随后他看见其中一条在海面转着圈游动，却始终没见到另一条的背鳍。

【535】I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.  
【535】我不可能指望杀死它们了，他想。要是在年轻时候倒还有可能。不过我已经让这两条鲨鱼都受了重伤，它们谁也不会好过。要是我能用双手抡棒子，肯定能打死第一条。现在也未必不行呢，他转念又想。

【536】He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed. The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.  
【536】他不愿再看那条鱼。他知道鱼身已经被毁掉了一半。与鲨鱼搏斗时，太阳早已沉落。

【537】"It will be dark soon," he said. "Then I should see the glow of Havana. If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches."  
【537】"天快黑了，"他说。"到时候我就能看见哈瓦那的灯火。要是往东走得太远，会看见新开发的海滩的灯光。"

【538】I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.  
【538】现在我应该离岸不会太远，他想。但愿没人太过担心。当然，只有那孩子会着急。不过我相信他一定有信心。好些老渔夫会担心的。还有不少别的人也会，他想。我住的这个镇子真好。

【539】He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly. Then something came into his head.  
【539】他无法再和那条鱼交谈，因为它已被毁坏得面目全非。这时他脑海中突然闪过一个念头。

【540】"Half fish," he said. "Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing."  
【540】"半条鱼啊，"他说。"你原本是条完整的鱼。真抱歉我出海太远了。我把咱俩都毁了。不过我们可宰了不少鲨鱼呢，你和我，还打垮了好多别的。你这一生宰过多少鱼啊，老家伙？你头上长着那只长矛可不是白长的。"

【541】He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife.  
【541】他喜欢想象那条鱼，想象它若是自由游动会怎样对付鲨鱼。我该把它的长嘴砍下来当武器，他想。可当时没有斧头，后来连刀也没了。

【542】But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you do?  
【542】但若真能砍下，再绑在桨柄上，该是多好的武器啊。那样我们就能并肩作战了。要是它们夜里再来，你如今还能怎样？你还能做什么？

【543】"Fight them," he said. "I'll fight them until I die."  
【543】"跟它们斗，"他说。"我要斗到死为止。"

【544】But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead. His shoulders told him.  
【544】此刻四下漆黑，不见灯火，唯有海风与船帆的持续牵引，老人恍惚觉得自己或许已然死去。他将双手相合，掌心相触。那触感分明未死，只需开合之间便能唤起生命的痛楚。他背靠船尾，双肩传来的知觉确证着自己依然活着。

【545】I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.  
【545】那些捕到鱼就还愿的祷词我都记得，他想。但此刻疲惫得无力念诵。不如拿麻袋披在肩上御寒。

【546】He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have half of him, he thought. Maybe I'll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.  
【546】他仰卧船尾掌舵，守候天际破晓。我还有半条鱼，他想。或许能走运把前半截也带回去。总该有点运气。不，他转念道，你驶得太远时就已透支了运气。

【547】"Don't be silly," he said aloud. "And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet."  
【547】"别说傻话，"他出声自语，"保持清醒掌好舵。说不定好运还在后头。"

【548】"I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it," he said.  
【548】"要是有地方卖这运气，我倒想买些，"他说。

【549】What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands?  
【549】我拿什么去买呢？他自问。能用一支丢失的鱼叉、一把折断的刀子，还有两只伤痕累累的手去买吗？

【550】"You might," he said. "You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too."  
【550】"也许可以，"他说。"你曾想用海上八十四天的光阴去买。他们差点就卖给你了。"

【551】I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead.  
【551】我可不能胡思乱想，他心想。运气以各种形式降临，谁能认得出她的模样？但无论什么形式我都愿意买，照他们开的价付钱。真希望能看见灯火的亮光，他想。我渴望的东西太多了。但此刻最想要的就是这个。他试图调整更舒服的姿势掌舵，身上的疼痛让他知道自己还活着。

【552】He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o'clock at night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream.  
【552】约莫晚上十点光景，他望见了城市灯火的倒影。起初那亮光如同月出前的天光般微弱难辨。随着微风渐起，海面开始翻腾，那灯光便清晰地横亘在远方的海面上。他驾船驶向那片光亮，心想此刻应该很快就能到达湾流的边缘了。

【553】Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon?  
【553】现在一切都结束了，他想。鲨鱼群很可能还会再来袭击。可是在黑夜里，手无寸铁的人能拿它们怎么办呢？

【554】He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so much I do not have to fight again.  
【554】此刻他浑身僵硬酸痛，夜寒浸透身上所有的伤口和用力过度的部位。但愿不用再搏斗了，他想。我真心祈祷不必再搏斗了。

【555】But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone.  
【555】然而午夜时分，搏斗还是来临了，这回他明白抗争只是徒劳。鲨鱼成群结队袭来，他只能看见鱼鳍在水面划出的纹路，以及它们扑向大鱼时泛起的粼粼磷光。他抡起木棒砸向鱼头，听见利齿咬合的声响，感受到鲨鱼在船底撕扯时小船的震颤。他拼命击打着那些只能凭触觉和听觉感知的敌人，突然有什么东西夺走了木棒——武器脱手了。

【556】He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.  
【556】他猛地将舵柄从舵上扯下，双手紧握，一次又一次地向下猛击猛砍。但鲨鱼群已涌到船头，接二连三地扑上来，成群结队地撕咬那些在海面下闪着光的鱼肉块，它们转身时又再度袭来。

【557】One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the tiller across the shark's head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish's head which would not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the last shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat.  
【557】最后有条鲨鱼径直撞向鱼头，老人知道一切都结束了。他抡起舵柄砸向鲨鱼头部——那两颚正卡在沉甸甸的鱼头里撕扯不动。他砸了一次，两次，又一次。听见舵柄断裂的声响，他便用锯齿状的断柄捅向鲨鱼。他感到断柄刺了进去，知道它足够锋利，于是又狠狠捅进去。鲨鱼松开嘴翻滚着逃走了。这是来袭的鲨鱼群中最后一条。它们再没什么可吃的了。

【558】The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of it.  
【558】老人此刻几乎喘不过气来，嘴里泛起一股怪味。带着铜腥气的甜味让他一时有些害怕。不过味道并不太重。

【559】He spat into the ocean and said, "Eat that, Galanos. And make a dream you've killed a man."  
【559】他朝海里啐了一口说："吃这个吧，加拉诺鲨。做个梦见你杀了人的梦去吧。"

【560】He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer. He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course. He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table. The old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and how well the skiff sailed now there was no great weight beside her.  
【560】此刻他终于明白自己彻底败了，败得毫无转圜余地。他回到船尾，发现锯齿状的舵柄末端恰好能卡进舵槽，勉强可以掌舵。他把麻袋披在肩上，驾着小船继续航行。此刻他轻快地航行着，没有任何思绪，也感受不到任何情绪。他已超脱一切，只是尽可能明智地驾着小船驶向家乡的港口。夜里鲨鱼群撕咬着鱼骸，就像有人在餐桌上捡拾面包屑。老人毫不理会它们，除了掌舵外对一切都漠不关心。他只注意到船边没了沉重的负担后，小船行驶得多么轻快平稳。

【561】She's good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller. That is easily replaced.  
【561】这船真不错，他想。它完好无损，除了舵柄外没受任何损伤。舵柄是很容易更换的。

【562】He could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore. He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home.  
【562】他能感觉到自己已进入海流，看得见沿岸海滩聚居地的灯火。此刻他清楚自己的位置，回家已不在话下。

【563】The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, he thought.  
【563】他想，风终究是我们的朋友。接着又补充道：有时候是。还有那浩瀚的大海，既有我们的朋友，也有我们的敌人。还有床，他想。床是我的朋友。就是床，他想。床将是极好的东西。当你被打败时，床就变得容易接受了，他想。我以前从不知道这竟如此容易。究竟是什么打败了你呢，他想。

【564】"Nothing," he said aloud. "I went out too far."  
【564】"没什么，"他大声说道。"是我出海太远了。"

【565】When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks. There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock.  
【565】当他驶入小港湾时，露台酒店的灯光已熄灭，他知道所有人都睡了。风势渐强，此刻正猛烈地吹着。不过港湾里很安静，他把船驶向岩壁下方那片小小的砾石滩。四下无人相助，他只好尽可能地把船拖上岸。随后他跨出船来，将船牢牢系在一块岩石上。

【566】He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well behind the skiff's stern. He saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between.  
【566】他卸下桅杆，卷起船帆捆好，然后扛起桅杆开始往岸上爬。这时他才意识到自己有多疲惫。他停下脚步回头望去，借着街灯的微光，看见那条大鱼巨大的尾巴竖立在船尾后方，裸露的白色脊骨像一条线，黑色的头部向前突出，中间是光秃秃的躯体。

【567】He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man watched it. Then he just watched the road.  
【567】他继续向上攀爬，到坡顶时摔倒了，桅杆压在肩上躺了好一会儿。他试图站起来，但实在太困难，便扛着桅杆坐在那里望着小路。一只猫在远处自顾自地走过，老人望着它。后来他只是呆呆地望着那条路。

【568】Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his shack.  
【568】最后他放下桅杆站起来，重新扛起桅杆沿着小路走去。在回到窝棚前，他不得不坐下来歇了五次。

【569】Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water bottle and took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up.  
【569】他走进棚屋，把桅杆斜靠在墙边。黑暗中摸到一个水瓶，喝了几口。随后面朝下躺倒在床上，将毯子拉过肩膀和后腰，盖住双腿，双臂直直地伸着，掌心朝上，就这样压着报纸睡着了。

【570】He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old man's shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw the old man's hands and he started to cry. He went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.  
【570】清晨男孩推门张望时，老人还在熟睡。风势猛烈，漂网渔船都不会出海，男孩睡过了头，这才像往常一样来到老人的棚屋。他看见老人尚有呼吸，又瞧见那双伤痕累累的手，顿时哭了起来。他轻手轻脚地出门去拿咖啡，一路上泪流不止。

【571】Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.  
【571】许多渔夫围着小船，打量着绑在船侧的东西。有个卷起裤腿站在海水里的汉子，正用钓线丈量那具白骨的长度。

【572】The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for him.  
【572】男孩没有走下海滩。他早先已去过那里，有位渔夫正替他照看着小船。

【573】"How is he?" one of the fishermen shouted.  
【573】"他怎么样了？"一个渔夫喊道。

【574】"Sleeping," the boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. "Let no one disturb him."  
【574】"睡着了，"男孩应道。他不在乎别人看见自己在流泪。"谁都别去打扰他。"

【575】"He was eighteen feet from nose to tail," the fisherman who was measuring him called.  
【575】"从鼻子到尾巴足有十八英尺长，"正在丈量鱼身的渔夫高声宣布。

【576】"I believe it," the boy said.  
【576】"我信，"男孩说。

【577】He went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.  
【577】他走进露台餐厅，要了一罐咖啡。

【578】"Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it."  
【578】"要热的，多加牛奶和糖。"

【579】"Anything more?" 【579】"还要别的吗？"

【580】"No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat."  
【580】"不用了。过会儿我再看看他能吃点什么。"

【581】"What a fish it was," the proprietor said. "There has never been such a fish. Those were two fine fish you took yesterday too."  
【581】"好大一条鱼啊，"老板说。"从来没见过这么大的鱼。你昨天钓到的那两条也很棒。"

【582】"Damn my fish," the boy said and he started to cry again.  
【582】"别提我的鱼了，"男孩说着又哭了起来。

【583】"Do you want a drink of any kind?" the proprietor asked.  
【583】"想喝点什么吗？"老板问道。

【584】"No," the boy said. "Tell them not to bother Santiago. I'll be back."  
【584】"不用，"男孩说。"让他们别去打扰圣地亚哥。我会回来的。"

【585】"Tell him how sorry I am."  
【585】"告诉他我有多抱歉。"

【586】"Thanks," the boy said.  
【586】"谢谢，"男孩说。

【587】The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man's shack and sat by him until he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.  
【587】男孩端着那罐热咖啡来到老人的棚屋，坐在他身旁等他醒来。有一次老人似乎要醒了，却又沉沉睡去，男孩只好到路对面借了些柴火来重新热咖啡。

【588】Finally the old man woke.  
【588】老人终于醒了。

【589】"Don't sit up," the boy said. "Drink this." He poured some of the coffee in a glass.  
【589】"别坐起来，"孩子说。"把这个喝了。"他往玻璃杯里倒了些咖啡。

【590】The old man took it and drank it.  
【590】老人接过杯子喝了下去。

【591】"They beat me, Manolin," he said. "They truly beat me."  
【591】"它们打败了我，马诺林，"他说。"它们真的打败了我。"

【592】"He didn't beat you. Not the fish."  
【592】"它没打败你。那条鱼可没有。"

【593】"No. Truly. It was afterwards."  
【593】"不，真的。是后来才发生的。"

【594】"Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the head?"  
【594】"佩德里科在照看小艇和渔具。鱼头怎么处理？"

【595】"Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps."  
【595】"让佩德里科把它剁碎当鱼饵吧。"

【596】"And the spear?" 【596】"那鱼叉呢？"

【597】"You keep it if you want it."  
【597】"你想要就留着吧。"

【598】"I want it," the boy said. "Now we must make our plans about the other things."  
【598】"我想要，"男孩说。"现在咱们得商量其他事了。"

【599】"Did they search for me?"  
【599】"他们找我了吗？"

【600】"Of course. With coast guard and with planes."  
【600】"当然。派了海岸警卫队和飞机。"

### 2.7. 🎯 601-627

【601】"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see," the old man said. He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea. "I missed you," he said. "What did you catch?"  
【601】"海洋浩瀚，小舟渺小难觅踪影，"老人说道。他发觉有人交谈是多么惬意，不必再独自对着大海自言自语。"我想念你，"他说。"捕到什么鱼了？"

【602】"One the first day. One the second and two the third."  
【602】"头天一条。次日一条，第三天两条。"

【603】"Very good." 【603】"好极了。"

【604】"Now we fish together again."  
【604】"现在我们又能一起捕鱼了。"

【605】"No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore."  
【605】"不。我不走运。我再也不走运了。"

【606】"The hell with luck," the boy said. "I'll bring the luck with me."  
【606】"去他妈的运气，"男孩说。"我会把好运带来的。"

【607】"What will your family say?"  
【607】"你家人会怎么说？"

【608】"I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have much to learn."  
【608】"我不在乎。昨天我抓了两条。不过现在我们要一起钓鱼，因为我还有很多要学。"

【609】"We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke."  
【609】"我们得弄根好鱼叉随身带着。你可以用旧福特车的弹簧钢板做矛头。咱们可以去瓜纳瓦科亚打磨。要磨得锋利但不能淬火，这样容易折断。我的刀就断了。"

【610】"I'll get another knife and have the spring ground. How many days of heavy brisa have we?"  
【610】"我再去弄把刀，把弹簧钢磨好。这阵强风还要刮多少天？"

【611】"Maybe three. Maybe more."  
【611】"也许三条。也许更多。"

【612】"I will have everything in order," the boy said. "You get your hands well old man."  
【612】"我会把一切都安排妥当，"男孩说。"您的手可得好好养着，老爷子。"

【613】"I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken."  
【613】"我知道怎么照料它们。夜里我咳出些怪东西，感觉胸腔里有什么东西碎了。"

【614】"Get that well too," the boy said. "Lie down, old man, and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat."  
【614】"这个也得养好，"男孩说。"躺下吧，老爷子，我去给您拿干净衬衫。再弄点吃的来。"

【615】"Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone," the old man said.  
【615】"把我出海期间的所有报纸都带来，"老人说。

【616】"You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything. How much did you suffer?"  
【616】"你得快点好起来，我有很多东西要学，你可以把所有本事都教给我。你遭了多大罪啊？"

【617】"Plenty," the old man said.  
【617】"够受的，"老人说。

【618】"I'll bring the food and the papers," the boy said. "Rest well, old man. I will bring stuff from the drug-store for your hands."  
【618】"我会带吃的和报纸来，"男孩说。"好好休息吧，老人家。我去药房给你弄点治手的药。"

【619】"Don't forget to tell Pedrico the head is his."  
【619】"别忘了告诉佩德里科，鱼头归他。"

【620】"No. I will remember."  
【620】"不会忘的，我记着呢。"

【621】As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again.  
【621】男孩走出门，沿着被磨得发白的珊瑚岩路往下走，又一次哭了起来。

【622】That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.  
【622】那天下午露台饭店来了一群游客，有个女人朝水里望去，在空啤酒罐和死梭鱼之间，看见一根又长又白的脊骨，末端连着巨大的尾巴。当东风在港口入口外掀起汹涌而持续的海浪时，那鱼尾正随着潮水起伏摆动。

【623】"What's that?" she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.  
【623】"那是什么？"她指着那条大鱼如今只剩等待潮水带走的残骸——那根长长的脊骨，向侍者询问道。

【624】"Tiburon," the waiter said, "Eshark." He was meaning to explain what had happened.  
【624】"提布隆，"侍者回答，"就是鲨鱼。"他正打算解释事情的来龙去脉。

【625】"I didn't know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails."  
【625】"没想到鲨鱼的尾巴这么漂亮，线条如此优美。"

【626】"I didn't either," her male companion said.  
【626】"我也是头回见识，"她的男伴应和道。

【627】Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about the lions.  
【627】沿路而上，老人又在他的棚屋里睡着了。他依旧脸朝下趴着睡，男孩坐在一旁守着他。老人正梦见那些狮子。
